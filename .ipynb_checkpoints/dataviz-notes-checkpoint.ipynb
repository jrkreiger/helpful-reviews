      "I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \"only 60 calories per jar!\" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a number of gourmet imported products and I enjoy trying them. One is a variety of Baxters soups from Canada. Today, I had the Butternut Squash and Red Pepper Soup. Quite good. Smooth and mellow. Mild taste, but delicious. Goes down real easy and it only comes to 90 calories per serving (2 servings per can). Alas, the sodium content is a bit higher than I like. Otherwise, very good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "When I'm working, I always carry my own lunch. It's so much better than the food court, and I have much better regulation of my nutrient intake. Finding items having high protein without high fat is the most difficult task. Tuna is excellent and these little Chicken of the Sea White Tuna Cups fill the bill. Put one in the lunch with a few fresh fruit and veggie items and perhaps a few dried fruits and nuts. It's good nutrition, and there's no worry about weight gain. Also, when I'm camping, I like to take a batch of these tuna cups along. In both cases, the cup size just the right for one serving.<br /><br />I had a minor problem with the latest tuna cups, and it might be just a batch problem. My latest tuna was very dry. I almost had to choke it down. And it seemed rather tasteless. I've had these cups in the past and they seemed much better. I have not been satisfied with the present ones. However, I like the product and the serving size and It will not deter me from future purchases.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked licorice candy and the best licorice I've ever had was obtained at Ikea. It was from Sweden. Yum! In any case, I've mentioned this around and then a box of Panda Soft Licorice appeared in my Christmas stocking.<br /><br />The Panda licorice is good. Real good. Excellent flavor. Nice and chewy. Good aftertaste. I'd rank it with the best I've had. It's imported from Finland and is made from all natural ingredients. In my opinion, it doesn't quite make it up to the licorice I obtain at Ikea, but it's close.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Market (an English company) has a variety of English fruit spreads and I'm enjoying trying them out. One of the latest is James Keiller & Son Dundee Ginger Preserve. Oh, my! This stuff is just delicious. I've always liked ginger, but as a spread it's just fantastic! What a nice flavor for my breakfast toast! I can hardly wait to try this out on other folks. Or I could give a jar here and there as gifts. I'm sure they'd be appreciated.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "For lunch today, I had a can of \"Wild Planet\" wild sardines packed in Extra Virgin olive oil. I served them over a bowl of brown rice and I pored much of the olive oil onto the mixture. For a bit of flavoring, I added a small amount of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce, an Asian treat from Thailand. Good lunch. Good mix of nutritional ingredients. Excellent sardines, by the way. Really good tasting.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I eat very little candy, but every once in a while I can't resist. Well, sometimes I'll try a candy substitute and on my last trip to the grocery store, I spotted some bags (2.75 ounces) of Werther's Original Hard Candies (Sugar Free). They're very low in calories. Okay, are they any good? Well, they taste a little like a very weak creamy caramel hard candy. I tired of them after the third one. They have a bit of an illusion of candy, but just don't match up. I doubt that I'll finish the bag. Oh well, maybe it's for the best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've consumed coffee ever since my youth in the 50s. Nowadays I will only use whole bean coffees and I've become somewhat fussy even there. Plus, there's the price to be considered. I've found that Trader Joe's and Kirkland Signature have some excellent selections of whole bean coffees at very reasonable prices. They can be very good values, as well as being excellent coffees. One of the latest I've discovered is Kirkland Signature Rwandan Whole Bean Dark Roast Coffee. I bought it at my local warehouse store in a three-pound bag.<br /><br />The Aroma is the first thing you'll notice. Boy, does this stuff smell good! The aroma is wonderful, perhaps even better than the coffee itself. Please don't take that as a negative statement. I'm just saying that if you want to impress guests, just open up a bag of this stuff and the comments will roll in. The coffee itself is quite excellent, as you would expect. It has a nice aroma and a rich dark taste. My own tastes might prefer a slightly lighter roast, but that's only my own tastes and not the fault of the coffee. If you prefer the rich, deep, strongly-coffee-flavored brew, give this stuff a try. Wonderful! And it's at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.\n",
      "I like to try new things and we have a British store nearby call the Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The other day when I was there I picked up a liter bottle of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant Fruit Drink imported from England. It's a concentrate and has no added sugar. You use one part of the concentrated drink with four parts of water. For the water, I choose an ice-cold slightly carbonated spring  water. Just mix and, viola, a nice tasting glass of fruit drink with a minimum of calories. Delicious! Very, very good. And the original bottle says it has 22 servings, although I may make up a little larger serving than they suggest. Well, what can I say? It tastes like a very good soda pop and has an absolute minimum of calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I used to drink a lot of soda pop until I started having problems with calories. Then I switched to diet sodas. After drinking such beverages for years, I was finally convinced that diet sodas weren't doing me any good. Whether they were harmful is open to debate. In any case, I'll still drink a diet soda if nothing else is available and I don't worry any about it. However, I discovered the Crystal Geyser flavored spring water and enjoyed it very much. I first tried the lemon and lime and the latter was my favorite. More recently, I picked up a case of the Orange. It's good! It has a nice zesty carbonation and a nice very light orange taste. I like it ice cold. It goes real well with meals and the 18-ounce bottle is just the right size.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We usually have a case of Orville Redenbacher Microwave Popcorn in the pantry for snacks. We prefer such things as popcorn and nuts much better than candy, and I think they are much better for you. It, after all, is just corn with a few flavors and we try to keep the flavoring to a minimus. Plus, it has a lot of fiber. The popping is perfect every time. We just set our microwave on \"popcorn\" and it comes out just fine with no further adjustment. We bought this 40-pack box of Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop at our local Costco warehouse store. We expect it will provide good snacks, have a good shelf life and last a long time.<br /><br />I might add, our young boy (three) just loves to go over to nearby Lake Murray and feed the ducks, coots and geese. We pop up a couple bage of microwave popcorn and let him stroll around and feeding the birds. He loves it. The birds seem to enjoy it too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber. Altogether, the combination made a good lunch, and it was quick and easy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I was in a local grocery store that has a lot of items imported from England when I saw cans of Heinz Spotted Dick Pudding. Well, I'd heard of it. Hasn't everyone? The name sounds more like a medical condition than a type of foodstuff and it must lend itself to a certain middle-school-level humor, not necessarily limited to those of that particular age. In any case, I had about a half can (too much) after lunch. I heated it up in the microwave and, after heating, coated it with a veneer of Devon custard. The combination was quite good. It's much too high in calories (from fats and sugars), of course, so I'll have to watch my consumption. However, it was an interesting treat and now when I hear the snickers, I'll understand a bit better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe\"s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says \"Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.\" Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy whole-roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've enjoyed several of the Bar Harbor fish and shellfish soups and thought highly of them. As such, I thought I'd try their New England Style Corn Chowder. It was good. I enjoyed it. But, for the same price, I'd prefer their fish and shellfish soups' The sodium content is way to high, in my estimation, and then they say you can add salt if you like. This was an acceptable soup, but I probably won't buy it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I just had a bowl of split pea soup for a part of my lunch. It was Amy's Organic Split Pea Soup and it was quite good. It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife lived in London for three years and developed a variety of British tastes. One such item was for rice pudding or creamed rice. Not too long ago I spotted Ambrosia Creamed rice (in 15-ounce cans) on the shelves of my local Fresh and Easy Store (a British company). Well, I just had to try it.<br /><br />Creamed rice is not bad. It's rather bland for my tastes and perhaps it's meant to go with certain types of food.. It's low in fat and sodium and not particularly high in calories, so I don't feel guilty at all.I prefer it chilled. It's smooth and creamy and I'd judge it to be a good product. But, it might take me a while to develop a taste for it. Right for the moment, I find it overly bland.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I first remember Martinelli\"s Apple Juice from the days when we used to use Martinelli's Sparkling apple juice as a non-alcoholic toast at Thanksgiving dinners. It was bright, fresh tasting and delicious. More recently, my wife bought a case of the 10-ounce bottles at our local warehouse store. We found out that our toddler loved the stuff. My wife wanted to pick up another case, but it was gone and hasn't returned as yet. So what are you gonna do? Well, it's available in other sizes, so today she came home with a couple 1.5 liter bottles. It's not as handy as the small bottles, but we'll make do. The important thing is the juice. She regards the bottle as important in that it is PBA free and that's important for the little one. She also likes fruit juices that are pure juice, especially if they are not from concentrate and have no added ingredients. Martinelli's Apple Juice fits her requirements. Plus, it's delicious.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store has a small section of premium soft drinks and some of them are really good. Just recently I purchased a 4-pack of Izze Sparkling Blackberry. It's an assortment of concentrated fruit juices dominated by blackberry with added carbonated water. The label says 70% fruit juices. This is not your average fruit-flavored soda pop, folks. This is real fruit juice and with no added  sugar. The taste is delicious and the blackberry stands out real nicely. The drink has a lot of natural sugars, but you don't get that sickening sweet taste I associate with so many of the  cheaper soft drinks. In fact, the drink has a slight sour bite to it and it's very pleasant. This stuff is more expensive, but maybe it's worth it. Personally, I'm looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I was browsing threw the snack isle of my local warehouse store and spotted a bag of Kirkland Signature Cashew Clusters with Almonds and Pumpkin Seeds. Hmmmm. Nice ingredients! Lightly held together with a candy glue and cut into little squares. Well, how could I possibly  resist? Into the shopping cart they went along with a nice-looking bag of trail mix. I love snacks like this. They're tasty and satisfy my snacking urges, yet they're made out of nutritious ingredients including protein and fiber. Did I mention that they're fresh and delicious? Plus, they have limited saturated fat, no trans fat and not very much sugar. Mmmmm, good. A Perfect treat, just so I don't eat too many.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a box of Wonderful Pistachios (24 1.5-ounce packets) on my last visit to my local Costco Store. They're a very nice pistachio. The roasting is perfect and they're lightly salted, just as I like them. The little bags are handy for snacks and lunches and are a way of keeping me in check when it comes to eating them. The pistachios are nicely opened and I've only found two \"uncracked\" so far. I save them in a pile and use the nutcracker on them when I get enough. The sodium content of a serving is quite modest relative to a lot of other nuts. The fat and calorie content is fairly high, but it's a less-harmful fat. The fiber and protein are moderately good. It's a nice mix of nutrients and a good taste.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We try to keep our pantry stocked with a number of items that can be used in a wide variety of situations, that require little preparation, that are nutritionally sound and that have a very long shelf life. One such item is Rosarita's refried beans and of the various types available we prefer the Traditional Variety. We buy them in cases of 8 16-ounce cans at our local warehouse club store, but they're widely available at almost any large grocery outlet. A variety of different brands are available, but Rosarita's Frijoles is by far our favorite.<br /><br />We use the beans in a wide variety of situations. We serve them with eggs or various types of meat. They can be used in a variety of situations where mashed potatoes might fit. We use them with items purchased from local Mexican restaurants and taco shops. We use them as side dishes with sandwiches. They take such minimal preparation that a serving of hot refried beans can be ready in a matter of minutes. And they're delicious. Plus, these beans pack a lot of excellent nutrition. They're high in protein and dietary fiber and low in fat. The sodium/potassium ratio is about even and a serving is only about 120 calories. Beans are notorious for producing gas, but we've never had a problem with Rosarita's Frijoles. It's an excellent food to have on hand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Tonight I had a light lettuce-based salad for dinner and, to go with it, I opened up an 18.6-ounce can of Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup (Healthy Request Variety). I thought it to be a rather bland-tasting chicken noodle  soup, but that's because most chicken soups have such a high sodium content. This one is relatively low and, in fact, the potassium content is higher than the sodium content, which is almost unheard of in Campbell's soups. It's fairly low in calories also so a whole can (two servings) only amounted to 220 calories. Also, the fat content is low and the protein content is fairly high. I'm surprised they don't label this a \"diet soup.\" Both the spiral noodles and the vegetables (carrots and celery) are fairly large and \"chunky\" and all seem bland and overcooked. I would not regard this soup as a particularly good one, but if you want to open a can of soup for a meal, the mix of nutrients is superior to most.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy shopping in a local Fresh and Easy Market because they have so many and such unusual imported items. They're a British company and most of their imported stuff is from England. Take this Heinz Classic Cream of Tomato Soup. Supposedly it has been made and sold for over 100 years. Well, if figured there had to be something good about it to import it when there are so many similar brands easily available. I was right. This stuff is really good. Yum! It might be more expensive, but man it's much better. Real rich savory taste. Low in fat and sodium. Tastes great with a lunch. Now I understand<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I discovered these little gems near the chips isle at my nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store. Somersaults. Hmmmm. Pacific Sea Salt. Crunchy nuggets baked with sunflower seeds and toasted grains. How could I resist? Into the cart it went.<br /><br />These little thingies are really good! Rich sunflower seed taste and very tasty. They're about the size of a thick quarter and they chew up real easily. Delicious taste, or did I already mention that? They have a nice salty taste, but aren't particularly high in sodium. How do they do that? They're high in fiber and protein. the fat calories are high, but it's the good fat. No trans-fats or cholesterol. Man, these are an excellent snack! I'm going to eat too many!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "The little grocery store where I shop had a display of Kraft Easy Mac macaroni and cheese in 2.05-ounce cups. So, I thought I'd test a couple. I've always liked their boxes of easy-to-fix macaroni and cheese and these would be really handy to have in the pantry shelves. Well, on the first one I really screwed up on the instructions. It was my own fault. I put the cheese powder into the water before microwaveing, not after. It was a disaster. The mixture boiled over and filled the microwave tray. What a mess, but I earned it. The next time I carefully followed the instructions and all turned out well. In 3 1/2 minutes, it was done to perfection, and quite easy, I might add. The mac and cheese tasted rather bland, not nearly as good as the brand I had been using. But, it certainly was quick and easy and in a nice one-serve container. Very handy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I remember Cracker Jacks from when I was a boy in the 40s and 50s. I loved Cracker Jacks. Plus, in looking back on it, they were one of the better candy treats. Sure, there was the sweet candy coating but underneath was nutritious corn and peanuts with nutrition and fiber. It was a good treat, no question. All this came to mind when I was in my local grocery store with my 3 1/2-year-old son and spotted a display of Cracker Jacks. I wondered if he too would like Cracker Jacks. Well, the answer was yes, as expected. We got the only size bag available, 4.25 ounces, but it's exactly the same Original product as listed here. And it tastes just as I remembered.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I tried out a packet of Somersualts, the ones flavored with sea salt. Well, they were just sensational as a snack so this time I'm back again to try the Salty Pepper  variety. Mmmmm. Good! These things are terrific! Such good taste and wonderful nutritional specs too. It's almost hard to believe. And they have a salty taste, but are not particularly high in sodium. Good fiber and protein. What more could you ask for? Well, the downside is that they're so good that I eat way too many of them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been looking for some snacks that have food value. I don't mind it if the calories are high, but I don't want just all sugar things. I want the snacks for my own consumption and for my little boy (3 1/2 years old). Recently, I found these Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates at my nearby Costco store. They're excellent in taste, as good a chocolate as you can generally find. They're sweetened with fruit juices, especially pomegranate. They're a dark chocolate and are a natural source of antioxidants. Did I mention that they're really, really good tasting? Did I mention that they're not particularly expensive? This is one item that fits the bill. The only difficulty is that they're so good you may have to worry about eating too many of them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife picked up a pack of Kellog's Special K Bars (blueberry variety). I'm not sure why because both of us tend to avoid such products. I guess maybe they're for the baby, because he's the one who's getting them. He likes them, of course. After he's done with his main meal, he often says \"bar'\" as if asking for a little desert treat and I know exactly what he means. He wants one of the Special K Bars. Well, OK, but I' somewhat against giving him this kind of \"candy\" food. One thing is certain, he likes the bars and one bar will calm him down.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, here's something new in treats, at least for me. I found them in a local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. They're Glico Pocky Chocolate cream covered Biscuit Sticks. Strange, but quite good. They're something like a 6-inch-long unsalted pretzel That has been  dipped in a tasty dark chocolate, except for the last inch. They're quite tasty and are not very calorie dense. You  can eat a whole box (one serving, and a rather large one) and it's only 200 calories. Hmmmm. They're from Japan.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. They're a British company and sell a lot of items imported  from England. It's fun to try out new things. One of the new items is a 15-ounce can of Ambrosia Devon Custard.<br /><br />This is good! The label suggest that it's good hot, but I like it chilled from the fridge. The texture is smooth and creamy. The taste is excellent. The calories and fat content are modest with cholesterol being very low. The sodium content is tiny. This stuff could easily be used as a topping for something. Use your imagination. Personally, I just enjoy eating a small bowl of it. Really delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need. Well, you'd never know it! They seem to always be hungry, day or night. What goes? I don't want to feed them again and get them to looking like Garfield. So, I got these Whiskas Temptations cat treats and I give them a few every now and them. Boy, do they go fast. The treats barely hit the dish and they're gone! Well, I notice they're only 2 calories per treat so they can't be doing much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I can remember Cheerios all the way back to my childhood and I'm now 75. We always seemed to have Kellog's Pep, Post Toasties and Cheerios on hand for the breakfast meal. I very seldom eat cereal for breakfast these days, but my wife does and Cheerios are one of her favorites. Lately, she's been bringing Chocolate Cheerios home and says that she prefers them to the original. I tried them and they are indeed good. My young son (three years old) loves them, seemingly better than the old Cheerios. Well, he can be hard to feed, so if he loves Chocolate Cheerios and they're deemed nutritious enough then that's part of what he's going to get.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I had a bowl of Cooked Organic Brown Rice for lunch today. The brand was Minsley and I found it at Costco in a packet/box of six bowls. The individual bowls could be microwaved for 90 seconds and then opened and stirred. It couldn't get any simpler. The rice turned out a bit stickier than expected, but no problem. The rice was quite excellent and this is such a handy way of fixing up a bowl! Then, the question is, what do you want with it? Well I had a can of wild sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil and I added most of the oil to the mixture plus a small amount of an Asian hot chili sauce for extra flavor. Very good. Add the quality of the brown Rice ingredients to the sardines in olive oil, and you have a nutritional powerhouse. This is a great product, and so handy. I'll be having it with a lot of other things.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This trip to my local grocer I spotted something new on the shelf in the soup area. It was Baxters Luxury Lobster Bisque in a 14-ounce snap-top can. I had to try it, of course. So, this evening I had  a pasta salad accompanied by Lobster Bisque. Both were excellent. It's a good, somewhat creamy soup with a fine light fishy flavor and aroma. Mmmm. I'm going to try a couple of their other varieties also.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A couple weeks ago I spotted some bags of Cracker Jacks at my local Fresh and Easy Market. I was amused in that it brought back old memories of how we used to eat Cracker Jacks as kids. I bought a bag and enjoyed the nice and crispy carmelized corn and peanuts. Then a couple days ago, I spotted some 24-bag cartons of Cracker Jacks at my nearby Costco Store. Hmmmm. What is this a Cracker Jack revival? In any case, I picked up a 24-bag (1.25 oz ea.) box of Cracker Jacks with the idea that I could use them as snacks or for lunches and for my little boy to enjoy. Supposedly, they have a little toy in each bag, just as they did in the old days, but the only toys I've found so far are some paper stickers, not like the things in the old days. Oh well, it's probably just as well. I can easily visualize my little boy swallowing those little metal or plastic gadgets that they used to have. In any case, these bags are quite good. Nice and fresh. Very handy. I hope my little boy likes them as well as I used to or I'm going to have a lot of lunch materials.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I recently discovered Coconut water to be available in a nearby grocery store so I've been trying several of the different flavors. The latest is Zico  Mango. It's all right. It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I noticed the Zico Coconut Water at my nearby grocery store and I tried a couple varieties of it. The drink was good, but nothing to write home about. However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I was cruising the snacks isles of my local Costco Warehouse store and found these Kirkland Signature \"Everybody's Nuts California Pistachios with Salt and Pepper\" in a three-pound bag. I couldn't resist! Yum! These are great! They're nice and fresh and have a zesty salt and pepper taste. I love just regular pistachios, which I usually buy, but these have an extra and quite delicious kick. Three pounds is a big bag, but these won't last long, I assure you.<br /><br />We're going to have a small party within a few weeks. I'm going to put a bowl of these out with the pre-meal munchies. My bet is that the word will spread fast and they won't last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago, I tried Chimes Ginger Chews and I loved them. I found them at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and, at the time I noticed there were two varieties available. I bought the \"original\" flavor. However, now in coming back I picked up a second packet (1.5 ounces) 0f Mango Chewy Ginger Candy. It's good. Real good. Wonderfully chewy. It has a strong ginger flavor, plus a strong after-taste of mango. Very unusual candy, and quite delicious. The chews come individually wrapped. Best of luck for getting them out of their wrappers. Believe me, you'll understand what I mean. It's well worth the trouble, however..<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I'm trying to increase the seafood part of my diet and my local grocery has a small display of canned seafood items. I'm trying them out. One of the items is Crown Prince Smoked Oysters in Cottonseed Oil (3.75 ounce can). It says that one serving size is one can and that seemed just about right for a light evening meal. I had the oysters with some low fat \"Wisecrackers\" having roasted garlic and rosemary. It was a good combination with the oysters. It was a good snack-sized meat and quite delicious. The oysters were a little high in fat and cholesterol but had 28 grams of protein, 28% of my daily needs! The oysters were quite good tasting and I'll be picking them up again in the future.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A light lunch for today consisted of a can (4.25 ounces) of Crown Prince Sardines in Louisiana Hot Sauce. I think I bought it at a local Fresh and Easy Market and I've had it in the pantry for some time. Well, I was surprised. It was a fairly good-sized can but had only two sardines. Well, I read somewhere that there is no legal definition to the word Sardine, so anything can be used as far as small fish are concerned. It doesn't say what kind of fish these are, but they're said to be wild caught and a product of Morocco. The hot sauce is zesty but not particularly flavorful. All in all, it's a good can of sardines, but not a great one.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I try to keep my candy consumption to the bare minimum. It's a matter of calories, certainly not taste. I love candy. Well, a few days ago a neighborhood lady brought us a one-pound box of Sees Chocolate and Variety Candies. She said that she's on a diet and can't eat candy. Great! Well, they're delicious! No question. Mmmmmm. Bet you can't eat just one! Back in my courting days, I always used to buy Sees Candies as gifts. There's a store only a few miles away. Well, they were always appreciated and I just don't know of a better candy. Gosh! Our box is almost gone already.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy a variety of beverages with my meals, and just for refreshment. I've tried any number of bottled teas and I like some of them. Personally, I've always thought that most were either too sweet (whether with honey, sugar or artificially flavored). I was mentioning this to my wife the other day and she came up with a packet of Ito En (Oi Ocha) Japanese Green Tea and suggested I try it. She said it came from Costco, but it's probably available elsewhere or here on Amazon. Well, I took a bottle (16.9 ounces) pored over ice and a later bottle chilled ice cold in the fridge. Excellent. Much better than other brands. Very smooth and light tasting with a ever-so slightly bitter aftertaste. Quite refreshing! Goes well with food. I particularly like the absence of any sweetness of any kind. Plus it has the antioxident qualities of green tea and a surprisingly high vitamin C content. It's a very quality beverage.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I picked up a 20-ounce bag of Kirkland Signature whole dried blueberries at my local warehouse club store. I like to have things of this kind around the house. They make an excellent healthy snack and I can carry little packets of them with my lunch. Plus, I like to take them along on camping trips where fresh fruit is hard to maintain. Also, these come in a resealable packet to help keep insects out between uses.<br /><br />These dried blueberries are excellent. They're somewhat chewy and granular and the experience of eating is much the same as eating raisons. However, the flavor is that of delicious nicely-ripened blueberries. In fact, the flavor is stronger than the flavor of fresh blueberries, which I also sometimes buy. It must be that the drying out process concentrates both the flavor and the sweetness, although I notice  sugar on the list of ingredients. In any case, they're quite an excellent dried fruit and provide a good antioxidant and fiber content. Yum! The cost is somewhat high, but have you ever checked out the cost of fresh blueberries?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I'm not certain how these \"Fruit by the Roll\" thingies got into the house. I would never buy them. Perhaps they're something left over from our last Halloween Day give-aways. In any case, neither my wife nor I will eat them, and I'm hesitant to give them to the baby. They're neither good fruit nor are they good candy. They taste about as much like fruit as Kool-Aid does. I tried one and it stuck tightly to my teeth. Great, just what I need, some sugary stuff stuck to my teeth. I'm going to make certain all are out of the house this Halloween, but maybe I shouldn't do that to the neighborhood kids. Perhaps I should just throw them out.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This was one of those afternoons when I was all alone and needed a quick afternoon lunch. So I opened a can of Amy's Organic Lentil and Vegetable Soup and added some crackers and a drink. It worked out well. The soup was thick and hearty and tasted rather well. If I had a complaint, I thought the soup to be a little bland. So I added a few squirts of Frank's Hot Sauce, one of my all-purpose brighteners, and that worked very well. It had a lot of fiber, was fairly low in sodium and sugars. The protein content was moderate. It made a good lunch, but not a great lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We try to keep candies, cookies, cakes and things of that sort out of the house, or at least keep their supply to a bare minimum. It's difficult. We try to stay well stocked on fresh and dried fruits as substitutes. However, there are those times when a treat seems in order. My wife found these Special K Bars and we keep a supply on hand. They're only 90 calories each and have a low fat content. They're made from whole grains. How bad can that be?<br /><br />I tend to prefer the strawberry variety. My wife has a preference for the Chocolate Drizzle. It really doesn't matter. I tend to think they're too sweet, too much like candy, but every once in a while I'll have one. When I'm carrying my lunch to work, I sometimes include one. We buy the large box and keep them in a sealed container. They have a long shelf life and must contain a lot of preservatives. Oh well, they're not a bad snack on those rare occasions. I might add that we never use them as a breakfast food.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife and I recently took a trip from San Diego to Great Basin National Park in east-central Nevada. It's about a 750-mile drive and we attempted to do it in a day. On the way there, I was getting real drowsy by the time we got to Las Vegas and we still had another 5 hours of driving. We'd stopped at a truck stop for gas and I noticed the little bottles of \"5-hour Energy\" drink. I'd seen them advertised on TV but had never tried any kind of energy drinks. Being somewhat cautious, I sipped about half or the small bottle, saving the rest for later. Well, it seemed to work fine.<br /><br />On the way back to San Diego, I was tired and drowsy right from the beginning. I was fighting sleep all the way from the park to Las Vegas, where we gassed up. Remembering the \"5-hour energy\" drink, I bought another little bottle for the seven-hour drive to San Diego. After driving for about an hour, I consumed the whole bottle. I was wide awake almost immediately. It was amazing! I still felt very tired, but I was awake and alert and remained  that way for all the remaining drive to San Diego.<br /><br />Other than the awakeness and alertness, I experienced no side effects at all. My wife hated the taste and said she would not drink it again, but then she wasn't the one who was driving. The taste seemed fine for me. Somewhat medicinal, perhaps, but no problem.<br /><br />This stuff is effective! I'll now always have a couple bottles in my car for any long drive. It's expensive, but well worth it. The cost by the case, by the way, is substantially less than the cost of single bottles in the truck stops.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Last week I picked up a four-pack of Virgil's Cream Soda. It was excellent! In fact, it was so good that I went back to the store and picked up a four-pack of Virgil's Root Beer which I had noticed on the shelf next to the cream soda. Yesterday, I had a couple, one in the afternoon and a second late at night. Well, what can I say? This is simply the best root beer I can ever remember drinking. It's nice and rich and creamy and wonderful tasting. They say it's micro brewed and is made of all natural ingredients. It's evident that the brew has had quite a lot of attention, quite the contrast to those mass-produced things that most people drink. It's expensive, but I'd estimate it to be only about 50 cents a bottle extra and I can afford that for the really exceptional taste. They list about 10 individual spices that are used and that's what it tastes like. You might recognize some of the individual flavors, such as the vanilla and licorice I could pick out. Of course, cane sugar syrup is used as a sweetener. This stuff is just sensational!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have a couple cats as a part of our household. They always seem to be hungry and underfoot when we're in the kitchen. We feed them twice a day and mostly with dry prepared cat food. One of them requires a prescription dry cat food because of a urinary problem. In any case, I'd think the little dears would get awfully tired of that dry crunchy stuff so every once in a while we give them some special treats. My wife bought a variety of Fancy Feast Appetizers for them and every now and then we split a flat between the cats in addition to the dry crunchy granules. Do they like the appetizers? Oh, yeah! But then, they're not really fussy and will eat almost any type of cat food. I guess, the treats mainly relieve our guilt feelings.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been looking over some alternatives to dairy drinks to go with my meals. Plus, I might add the meals of my little boy (3.5 years). So, I was looking around in a nearby Trader Joe's  and found this interesting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Almond non-dairy beverage. It has a good, if somewhat bland, flavor and goes down easily very much like a low-fat milk. The calories per serving are moderate but the fat is a little high. I should add that the fat is non-saturated and non-trans and there is no cholesterol. The 50-50 sodium to potassium ratio is about ideal. I think the drink is a little low in protein that I should substitute it for milk in my boy's diet. All in all, I'm favorably impressed and this was my first experience with an almond beverage. I'd have to rate it good, but not great.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've got a bit of a sweet tooth. Doesn't everyone? Well, I try not to keep candy and related sugar-packed items around the house because if I do, they'll disappear. But I do like sweets now and then. I've found a wonderful natural substitute: a product put out by Sun Date. I buy 2-pound (32-ounce) containers of dates, very much like illustrated here and put out by the same company. I found them at my local warehouse club. The ones I buy are Fancy Medjool Dates with pits. The ones listed here are unspecified pitted dates. I'm sure either would work, perhaps equally well. In any case, these dates make a wonderful sweet treat for people who are trying to stay away from manufactured sweets. Plus they offer a good source of dietary fiber. Outstanding snack!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Nuts are a major part of my diet and I've found one of the best sources at my local Costco Warehouse store. The problem is that they always occur in huge-sized bags or jars. Well, the last time I was there I spotted a 48 oz (3 pounds) box of Kirkland Signature Variety Snacking Nuts packaged as peanuts, almonds and cashews in 24 individual 2.0-oz bags. Perfect. I use individual bags for my lunch, for a snack, for taking along hiking or camping or for giving to my little boy (3.5 years old). Just right! The bags could be opened as needed and need no turn the whole batch stale. Besides, these are three of my favorite nuts. Good Taste. Good nutrition. Not too salty. Just right.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I have a 4-year-old son and I try to at least partly manage his nutrition. Sometimes he'll eat almost anything we put in front of him and sometimes he'll eat almost nothing. It's these latter episodes that bother me, so I try to have some snack foods around just to be sure that he gets enough. Take chocolate milk, for example. I can almost always get a glass in him and it's good nutrition. Another item is whole-grain fruit bars. I shop at Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Markets and usually buy their store brand. They're whole grain and organic and taste rather  good. If I give one to the boy it will almost always disappear in short order. Well, the last time I was there they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-grain Cereal Bars on half-price sale. I should have known better than to pick up a box of eight of the strawberry variety. I had one and it tasted fine, although I don't think it was as good as the store brand. My son wouldn't eat it. He just took one bite and that was it. I tried again the next day and got the same result. I don't understand it, but there's something about these bars that he just doesn't like. Well, maybe the guy has good judgement. I doubt that most people would notice, but he does.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I bought this 9-ounce can of Planter Cashews (halves and pieces) at my local Grocery store. Good product. The taste is excellent, although a bit too salty for me. They were nice and fresh and tasty and didn't last nearly long enough. Next time it will be a bigger size package.<br /><br />Halves and pieces. Hmmmm. Where and how do they get all the broken cashews? I couldn't find a single non-broken one. Oh well, I guess that's truth in labeling. But, how do they all get broken? Is there someone in charge of breaking them as they come down the production line? If they're accidentally broken and won't sell for as much as the non-broken ones, why isn't the price cheaper? Oh well, does it really matter? Once they're in my mouth, all will get broken.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a lot of exotic and interesting gourmet products. I enjoy trying them out. Today, there were several large boxes of Ines Rosales Sweet Olive Oil Tortas imported from Seville, Spain. So what is this? Well, I had no idea, but they looked good. So, I bought a pack of 6.3 ounces and it contained six tortas. Well, they're like a five-inch diameter thin crispy pastry disk that is somewhat like a pie crust. It's fragile and quite easily broken. The flavor is light and slightly sweet. The instructions suggest to serve them with cheese, perhaps also with coffee or tea. I had one with my evening salad meal. One of the tortas is listed as 14o calories and half of that is fat, presmably olive oil. So, now I know what tortas are. They're  a tasty item, but I doubt I'd buy a second pack.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's another of the little items I find in my nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. This trip I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies. Oh boy, are these good! They disappear real fast. Be ready to apply controls. They're very light and tasty and not overly sweet. The filing has a real light, fresh lemon taste. Real nice. Just right. Just give it a bite and a couple light chews and it's gone and your hand is involuntarily reaching for another one. Mmmmm. Now how am I ever going to keep these around the house? Well, I guess that a lot of others feel the same way. Did you notice that on the 33 reviews, 30 gave it five stars?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Market has a display of Kind Plus bars and I find it difficult to pass without picking one up. I like the nutritional specs and the low sugar content of the bars. Plus they're quite good tasting. I often have one as desert with my evening meal, as is the case tonight. This one was Almond Cashew with Flax. It was good, but I didn't care for it as much as several others. The chocolate one is my favorite. In any case, this is a good bar with good nutrition.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I like dried fruits, both as a snack and as an item to pack with my noontime work lunches. Plus, I almost always take them along when I go on camping trips. Nutritionally, they offer almost all the advantages of fresh fruit, but they don't require refrigeration and have a long shelf life if the bag seal is maintained. Typically, I buy the dried fruits in large bags and dole them out in smaller portions from there.<br /><br />Yesterday, I was in my favorite warehouse store and found a large bag (22 ounces) of Kirkland Signature Dried Mangoes and Cherries. Mmmmm, That ought to be good. Two different kinds of mangoes and two different kinds of cherries. Well, they're delicious! Nice mix of flavors. Fresh and chewy with a nice sweet and fruity taste. Yum! These won't last long!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has several varieties of Hi-Chew assorted fruit chews. I tried one about a week ago and liked it well enough that I came back to try a second variety. This one is a 3.53-ounce bag of Strawberry, Green Apple and Grape chews. They're good, but I don't like them as well as some of the tropical fruit chews I've had. Plus, they're just not the best imitations of the fruits they're supposed to represent. It would weigh on your personal taste, of course. One thing I like about these chews is that they don't seem overly sweet. One thing I don't like is that they come in individual wrappers and these are the toughest wrappers to get off that I've ever found in candies. I finally had to go and find a scissors. Fingernails just don't work. Don't even think about trying to open one while you're driving.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "On my last trip to Costco, I picked up a 26-oz. bag of Wild Roots coastal berry blend trail mix. It consists of almonds and cashews along with dried blueberries, cranberries and yogurt chips, It's somewhat high in fat and calories, but it's good vegetable fat. The taste is quite excellent. It's a good product and my only gripe was that the nuts were a bit stale, although the product had an expiration date of Feb. 2013. Well, the Trail Mix was good enough that I bought a second bag at Costco and it was nice and fresh and quite excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've had \"ginger ale\" as a soft drink off and on throughout my life, both the regular and the diet varieties. It was okay. Then I spotted Reed's Extra Ginger Brew (all natural Jamaican Ginger Beer) in my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. What is this, I wondered? Well, looked it over and decided I just had to try it. Oh, my! It was good! Really good! It was so superior to the \"ginger ales\" I've had that there was just no comparison. And this drink tasted like real ginger and it  was good and strong! Boy, this is a fine soft drink. A bottle has just about the same calories as regular soda and I note 37 grams of sugar. I'm going to have to watch it. This stuff goes down so easy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Recently, I picked up a 30-ounce plastic jar of \"Ann's House Soy Energy Blend\" which I discovered in the snack isles of my local Costco warehouse store. It's a mixture of soy nuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. I'm a sucker for things like this. I can use them as a healthy snack. I can pack them in little sandwich bags and include them in my lunch package. I can bag them up for snacks in hiking walks. My wife likes them too. We snack now and then but we try to avoid salty and sweet snacks and stick to things that are nutritionally sound. These things fit the bill. They're a little bland tasting and you might wish that they were salted at least a little bit, but the protein and fiber content will make up for any taste deficits, at least in my book. It's a good snack. I love discovering things like this!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I spotted this Mae Ploy sweet Chili Sauce (12-ounce bottle) in the international section of a local grocery store. It's imported from Thailand. I use regular chili sauce in a variety of ways and I love to try variants such as this. Into the shopping cart it went. Well, my, oh my, this stuf is excellent. It's both sweet and somewhat hot and has a nice variety of spicy flavors dominated by pickled red chili. So far, I've used it on eggs and small frozen dinners. Excellent. I can hardly wait to try it out on meats. This is, indeed, a very interesting variation from my ordinary chili sauce!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's an item that we like keeping on the kitchen shelves. It's a 13.5 ounce plastic jar of Kirkland Signature Dried and Chopped onions. We usually use fresh onions wherever possible, but these fine-grained chopped onions lend themselves for using in meat balls, meat loaf, soups where the fine grain size is important and in a variety of dips. Nice taste. Easy to store. Long shelf life. Ours is now over the \"best by\" date, but the still work fine and I wouldn't think of throwing them out. It's a good, useful product to have around.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Hmmmm. I read somewhere that a little dark chocolate is now good for you. Well, I was passing the desert isle in my nearby Fresh and Easy Market and there were some Gamesa Sugar Wafers. I had tried the Vanilla ones and then felt guilty afterwards. The were sure good. Imported from Mexico. But today, there were also some Chocolate Sugar Wafers next to the vanilla ones. How could I resist? Especially after reading about the benefits of a little chocolate in your diet. Into the cart a 6.7-ounce packet went. Mmmm. They're good. Nice and fresh and tasty. Now the trick will be to keep the amount down.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been trying out a variety of snack items with the idea of finding something that is both tasty and nutritionally sound. These Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps (Everything) caught my eye and seemed worth a try. They're okay, but I really don't care for them all that much. Mine are nice and crisp, but they have a taste somewhat like slightly stale matza. Perhaps I just got a stale bag. Well, at least the fat and sodium are low and they're not too high in calories. I can't quite see putting them on the table for guests. Perhaps I might try one of the other flavors before abandoning them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Some time ago I ran out of chicken-flavored bouillon cubes and the store had none. However, they had 7.9 ounce jars of same. Well, I'd never tried the jars before but why not? As it turned out, I preferred the jar to the cubes. Well, next I was out of beef bouillon cubes and ran into the same problem. Same solution too. I bought the 7.9 ounce jar. It's excellent. Just yesterday I made a beef-flavored soup/stew and used the bouillon as a flavoring agent. Everything turned out perfect. This stuff has a real high sodium content, so I eliminated salt as an ingredient. The result was excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby grocery store carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry.<br /><br />Gsry Peterson\n",
      "We have a three-year-old toddler. He's a somewhat picky eater and it's always hard to tell just what he might like at any particular time. One thing is certain, no matter what food mood he might be in he will almost always accept milk. Of the various milks available, he likes the flavored varieties best and chocolate milk is his first choice. At first we were buying it in large containers. Then we switched to these small Horizon 8-ounce aseptic cartons. They're just about the right size for a serving. Plus, they're easy to store. Furthermore, I can easily transport them about for a snack on the spot. Just today, for example, we took him to a restaurant and, as you might guess, he would have none of it. Well, I reached in my pocket and pulled out a chocolate milk for him. That solved the lunch problem. We like the size and the convenience. The kid just loves the product, especially the chocolate. Having them around makes for a great snack for the rest of us too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I have two cats, both neutered males. One has to receive special prescription food because he has a tendency to develop little crystals in his urinary tract. The food is expensive. The other cat is not at all finicky and will eat anything that is presented to him and beg for more. Well with him I just buy the available foods on the grocer's shelves and I try to rotate the brand and type around from time to time. Actually, I don't think it makes a bit of difference but I do it anyway. How would you like to eat exactly the same thing day after day? Well, this time the grocer had a couple different kinds and one was Friskies Griller Blend. A small tab says it's made by Purina. Hmmm. I always thought they were two different companies. Friskies, Purina, Whatever, The cat just loves it! Of course, he loves all cat foods so I guess it doesn't really matter and he always seems to keep in perfect health.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I discovered the Sparkling Ice beverages about month or so ago. They're quite good and come with a variety of characteristics I like. They're zero calories which is good for my weight watching. They are ever so slightly carbonated but nowhere near the typical carbonated soda. They're only slightly sweet. I tend to like the much lower sweetness Even no sweetness might be better. The taste is mild but excellent and I like the Orange Mango better than the other two flavors I've tried (lemon-lime and raspberry). The bottle is 17 ounces so you can go it alone or easily split it for two. I bought it at a local store but things have a way of appearing and then disappearing, so it's good to know it's available on line. Good product! Light and refreshing!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked sardines. I guess a lot of people don't. Their loss. So, last week I picked up a few cans at my local Fresh and Easy Market.  They were Crown Prince Brisling Sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil. They were a bit more expensive than the last brand, but they were worth it. Delicious! Nice wood-smoked flavor, but not overly strong. They were high in oil, but it was olive oil with a good content of Omega 3, a type that is healthy and good for you. Wild caught, not farmed. Attractively packed in two layers. And, it's a product of Scotland, not China. Excellent sardines!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.5-ounce bag of Barbara's Shackimals Chocolate Chip animal crackers. I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A few weeks ago I picked up a couple noodle bowls that I can keep in the pantry for occasional lunches or things like that. One was the Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup Hot and Spicy (Beef Flavor). It's real easy to prepare and I just follow the simple instructions. I use the microwave method and it's ready in a matter of minutes, The flavor is good. It's spicy, but not overly so. Strangely, although it doesn't seem overly spicy to the taste, if I inhale the fumes it irritates my nasal passages somewhat. I have had to learn to eat it without inhaling. The sodium is high so I don't like to have things like this very often and I'm careful of sodium the remainder of the day. The protein content is too low for a complete meal, so I add a few protein items. Today, I added a couple pieces of beef jerky. All in all, I'd say it's one of the better beef-flavored bowls I can remember. It's good to have a few handy things like this around but I wouldn't want them to become a major part of my diet..<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our boy (17 months) is going through teething and we like to get him foods that he can hold in his hand and bite pieces off. He enjoys it too. He likes a variety of crunchies made for babies, fruit bars and crackers. We've fed him several different kinds of animal crackers. A little while back we were roaming the aisles of our local warehouse store and my wife spotted this four-pound container of Kirkland Signature Animal Crackers. Into the shopping cart it went.<br /><br /> Our boy loves these animal crackers, which is a good thing because we've now got so many of them. Both my wife and I tried them and thought they were delicious. They're nice and fresh and have a slight vanilla flavor. They're all organic and have the seal of approval of Disney. It's a good product and I suspect they'll go fast.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "The Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market nearby has a variety of gourmet candies and I enjoy trying them. Many, if not most, are imported. One of the types they have are three different kinds of Chimes Ginger Chews. I tried two of the kinds and enjoyed them very much The third was a Peanut Butter Ginger Chew. Somehow, the idea of ginger mixed with peanut butter just wasn't all that attractive to me. Finally, I got around to trying them and purchased a 1,5-ounce bag. Well, they're a good candy, but I'll go along with my instincts and say that they aren't as good as the other two varieties. However, like the others, they have a nice gingery taste, here subordinated by the peanut butter, they're nice and chewy and they're not overly sweet, It's a good candy, and if you like peanut butter you might really enjoy the chews.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our baby was born in early October. My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.<br /><br />We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell. However, if anyone is having this problem, I'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I always stock a variety of items on my kitchen shelves that might be used as an instant lunch in times when I'm in a hurry and don't have any time to prepare things. One of my long-time favorites is the Maruchan Instant Lunch cups and I presently have the beef flavor. They also come in several other flavors. The cost is minimal. They're real easy to prepare real. Just peel back the top, add hot water and let it set for about three minutes. Have a few things like cheese, fruits, meat along with your noodle soup and, viola, an instant lunch. Works real well and is tasty. My only reservation is the very high salt (sodium) content. It's listed at 1,200mg, which is about 50% of the daily recommendation. In one serving! Wow! It's an easy and quick lunch, but you'd better watch your other salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "With work, a new baby (16 months) and all, we're a real busy couple. Meals can be a problem. One of our solutions is to keep a goodly stock of Pasta Roni (Herbs and angle hair pasta is our favorite) in our pantry. We can fix up a batch in a matter of minutes, add a vegetable or and meat (heated in the microwave, of course) and the Pasta Roni makes up a nice complimentary side dish. It's not gourmet fare but it's quick and easy. Very handy product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "When I visit a Japanese restaurant, one of the things I always like is a small bowl of miso soup. Well, I was looking through the international food section in my local grocery store and I found these three-packet bags of Marukome Miso Soup Mix. All you needed to do was take one of the small packets and add a cup of hot water, stir and enjoy. So easy. Well, I was disappointed. It just didn't mark up. Well, what did I expect? It's just a little packet and hot water. There's no way it could mark up to a couple Japanese places I go. Actually, it's not really bad at all. The sodium content is much too high, of course, and the tofu just doesn't come through very well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I'm always looking for snacks that might be tasty and nutritionally good at the same time. A month or so ago I found \"Majans Bhuja Cracker Mix\" and liked it very much. As such I continued looking and found \"Majans Buja Original Mix. It's a rather similar assortment of rice crackers, crisp noodles, green peas, peanuts, and sultanas. Plus, there's an assortment of flavors and other minor ingredients. It's crunchy and  chewy and tastes good. The calories are not particularly high and the snack has a good protein and fiber content. It's low fat with no cholesterol. The sodium content is fairly low. Nice mixture of characteristics. One thing I might add that this snack is fairly filling. I've had little tendency to eat the whole bag at one sitting such as I can often do with potato chips and things of that sort. It's a product of Australia. I discovered it in a nearby Fresh and Easy Store, which happens to be and English company. It's good to find a few snacks like this and Bhuja come in several varieties, juist in case you like to switch around a bit. I find these a bit spicy and prefer the other variety I had.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A few days ago we had a birthday party for our three-year-old son. My wife put together a variety of small gift packages for the attending kids and included a small handful of gold-foil covered chocolate coins in each package. They really looked real and it took a while before the kids realized they were candy. Also, they're real hard to unwrap with tiny fingers. All in all, they went over big and my son still has a modest collection.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I first discovered Somersaults a couple weeks ago and they were quite good. Not only did they taste exceptional (Sea Salt and Salt and Pepper varieties), but the nutritional content was excellent, quite in contrast to most snacks. As such, I bought a third variety and this one was the Dutch Cocoa. Alas, I just don't care for these at all. The first two tasted like a very interesting salty and nutty snacks. These tasted like stale cookies. Okay, some people might like them, but I'm not one of those. I'd still say that they're good in their nutritional value, but I don't care for the taste on this variety. I'm going to have trouble finishing the bag.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I've never had canned Papaya before. But there it was! My local Fresh and Easy Srore had a stack of about a dozen cans of Native Forest Organic Papaya Chunks on sale at a big discount. I guess they were stopping stocking the item and just wanted to get rid of the ones they had. Well, I'll certainly give it a try. My previous experience with papaya was fresh (in Hawaii, oh man was it good!) and dried in several varieties (quite good). Okay, here's fresh organic papaya chunks packed in organic pineapple juice. Does that sound good, or what? Hmmm. It's a product of Sri Lanka. Well, I've never had anything from Sri Lanka before.<br /><br />This can of papaya chunks is excellent!! The taste is real good and it must have been canned right at the peak of ripeness. Good as it is, it's not very high in calories (60 per serving and three servings per 14-ounce can). It's quite sweet, but I note there's no added sugar, it's just papaya and pineapple juice. Of course, it's got zero fat and no sodium either. Plus there some fiber and a lot of vitamin C. Boy, this stuff is not only delicious, it's just the nutrient mix I seek. I'm going to have to go back and buy up the whole display!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Tonight I again shopped  for a take-out meal at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I chose a packet of 8 California Shrimp Tempura Rolls with a nice soy sauce and bit of wasabi. For a drink, I went to the drink display and chose a 16.9-ounce bottle of Ito En Oi Ocha Green tea. Nice combination. Went down well. I've had the Ito En Green Tea before and it's absolutely first rate. It's non-sweetened. Just brewed tea and a little Vitamin C. The tea has a nice light bouquet, goes down like a soft, very-good-tasting water and has a nice green tea aftertaste. Excellent! No wonder this is Japan's leading brand of green tea.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been on a campaign to increase the seafood part of my diet and I've stocked up on a lot of canned seafood items, one of which is Crown Prince Baby Clams (smoked, in oil). I enjoy things like this for a light lunch. Just today I opened a can of the baby clams and had them with Wisecrackers (with Roasted Garlic and Rosemary). They were excellent. Nice lunch. The taste was good with the light smoke flavor. I'd prefer the smoked oysters, but that's just a matter of personal taste. The only difficulty was keeping the cats at a distance.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I really enjoy whole-bean coffees. Once you're used to them you just can't go back to coffee from a can, much less to instant (ugh!) coffee. Once you're into whole-bean, grind-it-yourself coffee, the coffee you get at other places tastes like dishwater. Well, maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but you get the idea. In any case, I like to try whole-bean coffees from all the major growing areas of the world and in all of the different roasts. I generally buy it in two- or three-pound bags and I seldom repeat the same coffee when I buy a new bag. I like variety. I generally buy my beans at Costco. They only seldom have more than two or three varieties present on any particular shopping day, but they seem to change so when you come back different varieties and roasts may be present. Alternatively, on-line is an excellent source if you really get into it or don't have a good local source. I tend to be too price sensitive and have three Costco warehouses within a five-mile radius of my house.<br /><br />My latest acquisition os a three-pound bag of San Francisco Bay French Roast Beans. My previous beans were a medium roast, so I thought this would make a good change. I knew I was right when I cracked open the bag. Mmmm. What a nice rich aroma! Nice smell while brewing too. While it was brewing, I went outside to get the morning paper. A headline caught my attention so I spent perhaps five minutes reading the story. Then I went back inside. The newly-brewed coffee aroma was just overwhelming! That's my kind of coffee! It would be nice to have guests come in and get a whiff of this brew! And the taste, oh my, oh my! Rich. Full bodied, yet not the least bit harsh. Ahhhh, this stuff is a nice break from the last medium-roast bag, but the last bag was good coffee too. Man, this brew will grow hair on your chest (just a little joke, folks). How could anyone ever drink anything other than whole-bean coffees?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have two cats, both neutered males that are totally indoor cats. One is a large black and white longhair we call \"The Fuzz.\" He's six. The other is a medium-sized. solid medium-gray shorthair who resembles a Russian Blue. We call him Boris and he's five. It's difficult to satisfy their needs for food. The Fuzz is somewhat fussy and always seems to be hungry, although he's the proper weight. Boris will eat anything and is a specialist at licking plates clean. He's thin and slinky. However, Boris has a condition wherein he develops urinary tract crystals and has to be fed an expensive prescription cat food to remain healthy. It works, I might add. As such, they have to be fed separately.<br /><br />We've settled in on Purina Cat Chow (Indoor Formula) for The Fuzz. He seems to like it better than any of the others and it's easy to find and it's cheap. His health has been perfect. We're very satisfied with it, as is The Fuzz. Boris is satisfied with his prescription diet. Unfortunately, The Fuzz likes it too and it's five times as expensive as his regular food so we have to keep them separated during the feeding times twice a day. What a pain. It seems ironic that the one who is fussy gets along on the cheap food and the one who will eat anything placed before him needs expensive prescription food. Go figure. Such is life with cats.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A couple years ago I picked up a bag of Philippine Dried Mangos and I can still remember how much I liked them. I found them at Costco, but when I returned to pick up another bag they were gone. I wanted to write a review telling others how good they were, but Amazon didn't carry them at the time. Well, today I visited Costco again and they were back. Yum. I just had to pick up a 30-ounce bag. And they're just as delicious as I remembered.<br /><br />I use these dried mangos as a snack, as an item I put into my bagged lunch and I like to take them and other dried fruits and nuts along on camping trips. The only problem I have with them is that they're hard to stay away from. Excellent treat!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I discovered that my nearby Fresh and Easy Grocery Store (an English company that has all kinds of imported English items) stocked a number of concentrate drinks and I've been trying them out. They're quite good and low in calories. My latest is Robinson's Lemon Barley Water Drink. To make a drink you add one part of the Robinson's concentrate and four parts water. Just the pouring together will mix them, or go ahead and stir them if you like. A tall glass drink will contain about 40 calories (my estimate at about two servings). That's quite low. The drink tastes a lot like a real good lemonade. It's not very sweet, nor is it sour. It's just quite tasty, that's what it is. Good drink. Goes well with meals or just for a refreshing break.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's one I would never have anticipated. When our 10-month-old son first started going on solid foods, my wife spotted these \"cheese puff\" things in our local grocery store. Our boy instantly loved them. We now use them in a variety of situations. We have a container in the baby's room and another in his stroller and in the car. They all work in much the same way. Whenever the boy gets cranky, we show him the container and it immediately grabs his attention. He gets real excited when we open it and hold out a crunchy. It almost always stops the whining immediately. Amazing! We've even had him in the grocery store and he got real excited when he spotted them on the shelf. That time we had to buy the puffs just to get through the rest of our shopping.<br /><br />In any case, the Lil' Crunchies resemble Cheese Puffs for adults, but have a much milder flavor. They seem to dissolve in the mouth and have presented no choking difficulties as long as we wait for the first to be gone before giving the boy a second. Now that he's teething, he likes to attempt to chew them up. The Crunchies are available in several flavors, but the boy likes the cheese the best. It's an interesting product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked licorice and I've tried quite a variety of types. Well, here's a new one. It's salty licorice and I found it at our nearby IKEA store. It has a real fine, rich licorice taste plus it's quite salty. It's tough and chewy, perhaps somewhat like a fairly hard gummy bear in the shape of a fish. Nice mix. My wife (Russian) says it's more characteristic of northern European candies which tend to be less sweet. This licorice is imported from Sweden.<br /><br />You may find this a delicious candy and have trouble putting it down. That's my problem. On the other hand, you may not like it at all. Licorice sold in the U.S. tends to be much sweeter and less flavorful. If you're used to this type and then try these salty licorice fish, you may find it quite startling. My take is that it's startlingly good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My latest candies from a nearby store which sells British imports is Rowntrees Fruit Gums in an 8-sweets roll. They're good but I didn't like them nearly as much as Rowntrees Fruit Pastilles. The Fruit Gums are mildly flavored, but quite delicious. They're very chewy and stick to you teeth rather badly. Be sure to brush if it's before bedtime and be careful not to pull any fillings. My impression is that the flavor becomes more intense as you continue to chew and I find it most flavorful to chew two of the same flavor at the same time. Or, mix your flavors if you prefer. It's your dime. It's a nice candy, second only to the Fruit Pastilles from Rowntree.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Cheez-It crackers are one of my favorite snacks. I try to avoid them ad much as possible in order to maintain my medial diameter. It's difficult. Great care must be taken in passing them in the grocery store's cracker/cookie isle. Just the other day I was there and something distracted me. When I looked up, there were the Cheez-its. I couldn't resist. That evening I finished half the box  while watching a movie. They're that kind of snack. Goldfish are good, to be sure, but they're nowhere near as addicting as Cheez-its. No, Cheez-it's are #1. Now, I'm going to have to work on rebuilding my resistance.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's an item I picked up at a nearby Fresh and Easy market. They're a British company and they have a lot of imported European items. One of the latest that I picked up is a 5.3-ounce box of Petite Ecolier (Little Schoolboy) dark chocolate with biscuits. Each of the very delicious biscuits is topped with a thick wafer of very dark (70% cocoa) chocolate. Man, that really makes a delicious cookie! Yum! I can't recall ever having better. My thoughts were that these just had to be high in calories. Sure enough. One serving (two biscuits) packs 130 calories. It figures, doesn't it? Well, you know, I was reading that a serving of chocolate every day, particularly dark chocolate, is actually beneficial to one's health. Well, here's to my health!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our 11-month-old boy is teething and starting on solid foods. We've been giving him more and more solids for a number of months now. You'd be amazed at the things he loves to eat, such as french fries for example. In any case, my wife found Gerber's Graduates in a variety of forms and the boy seems to like them all to one degree or another.<br /><br />One of the varieties our boy likes is the Graduates puffs. They come in several flavors and the present ones we have are the apple-cinnamon. Previously we had some banana-flavored ones. In any case, the  specific flavor seems to make little difference. The little puffs are about 3/8 inch across and are star shaped. We give them to the boy one at a time, which gets somewhat tiresome. So, we place a small handful on his high-chair tray now and then. He attempts to get them all in his hand and then put them all in his mouth at the same time. What are you gonna do? He seems to like chewing them up, as best as he can, and we've had no problems with him choking or anything like that. It's a good product, but we, and the boy, prefer the Cheeto-like larger crunchies.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.\n",
      "I bought three of these Van Ness Cat Litter Scoops at Wal-Mart about five years ago. I got excellent service out of them. I use the \"clumping\" cat litter and I tend to be somewhat negligent in cleaning the litter box. As such, a lot of the clumps can be stuck together. I've broken a couple of the scoops in attempting to break them apart. It's not the scoop's fault. It's my fault. Or maybe we could say that it's the litter's fault in that it has such a good odor control that I don't even notice the box needs freshening.<br /><br />Ah well, I paid less than a dollar each for these things at the time and they've lasted all these years, I'd say it was an excellent product well worth the money. I now bought a new one of a different brand and I hope it works as well. So far it has.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our baby (11-months-old) is now on solid foods and we try to feed him a great variety of items. The doctor said he could eat the same foods we eat. Well, that's good to know but we need a things that are easier to eat. In part, we make up concoctions of our own dishes but reduced to a mush. In addition, my wife found this Earth's Best Organic line of baby foods at a local store. They have quite a lineup of foods, but the brand and all varieties can be a little hard to find.<br /><br />One thing he seems to like are fruit and grain mixtures, so we picked up a variety pact as well as individual jars and we include a jar in his daily intake. My wife likes the organic aspect with no preservatives or additives and the baby seems to enjoy the foods. We're gradually trying more and more of the Earth's Best Organic lines of food, and we've been very satisfied so far.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have a nearby Fresh and Easy store and I enjoy  shopping there. It's an English company that has invaded the American scene, I like them for a variety of reasons but one is that they carry  a number of exotic items that I've just never seen anywhere else and I enjoy trying them. One such item is \"Doctor Kracker Pumpkin Seed Cheddar Crispbreads. Eight 3\" by 4\" come cellophane-wrapped in a 7-ounce box. These are great. They're about the crispest cracker I've ever eaten and the flavor is mild but excellent. Plus, they're a whole grain cracker with a lot of fiber and no sugar so they're low on calories. Mmmmm, good! These things are great! I can hardly wait to try  the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I used to regularly eat rice cakes and then I got out of the habit and haven't even seen them for years. Suddenly I spotted some Lundberg Eco-Farmed Brown Rice Cakes at my nearby grocery store and had to have them. They're made of whole-grain brown rice and are very lightly salted. They're nice and fresh and crispy and good tasting. I like to have them for breakfast with spreads ranging from peanut butter, Nutella, and a variety of fruit spreads. And they're only 60 calories a cake. Excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago, I picked up a two-pack of 15-ounce Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce at my local warehouse club store. It's been years since I had any of this product and, boy, does it taste delicious! I use it as a general-purpose flavoring agent on all sorts of things, not just steak. I even tried it with macaroni and cheese! It's an excellent additive for lots of dishes.<br /><br />It's billed as \"The Original\" Worcestershire Sauce and a lot of critics have pointed out that it uses high-fructose corn syrup rather than sugar in the recipe and, thus, is not the original recipe. Well that may be but I have no way to get the original formula from England so this American version will have to do. I'd like to try the English version, but, in the meantime, this American stuff is excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Mmmmmm, San Diego tap water. We get most of our drinking water from the lower reaches of the Colorado River, the waste drain for about 2/3 of the western US. Fortunately, the drainage basin is only sparsely populated. The water is safe. I've lived in San Diego for 49 years and there's never been a water problem of any magnitude. A lot of people won't drink it, including my wife. She'll only drink bottled water and the more expensive it is, the better it is. For a while she was drinking water imported from Figi and said it was the best water she's ever tasted. Well, you guessed it. It was also the most expensive bottled water she's ever consumed.<br /><br />Some people say that San Diego tap water smells bad. Fortunately, my sense of smell isn't that keen. A lot of people say it tastes bad. I guess my sense of taste isn't so keen either. I don't mind San Diego tap water at all. One thing I do note is that if you fill a glass and then let the glass evaporate dry, the interior of the glass is coated with a scummy white lining. Well, If you're drinking the water, you're also consuming whatever all that white stuff is. I assume it's just mineral matter which is especially common in arid areas, but who knows?<br /><br />In any case, I was recently browsing our nearby grocery store and found an interesting product. It's called MiO Liquid Water Enhancer and comes in a variety of different flavors. You put a drop, or any amount you might like, into a glass and then fill the glass with water, in my case tap water. There's no need to mix or anything. Now you have slightly flavored or enhanced tap water. The flavor I chose for trying was Berry Pomegranate. It says there's 24 servings in the little bottle, but the number would depend on how liberal you are with the little squirt you put in. I tried it a few times and prefer only a very slight enhancement, so my bottle will probably last a lot longer. I'm definitely not looking for something that tastes like soda pop. Well, the slightly enhanced San Diego tap water is kinda nice. It tastes good. The only odor I can detect is the slight fragrance of the additive. Hmmmm. This  stuff could be a big seller in areas like San Diego!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market added a new brand of soft drinks to their cooler and I tried a couple. The latest I had today was Cascal Bright Citrus Natural Soda in a 12-ounce can. Quite good! I can't really pick the dominant flavor, but it lists lemongrass, tangerine and pineapple with added effervescence. The drink is 35% juice. It has a fresh, somewhat sour taste and is not sweet at all, which I like, and it's listed at only 80 calories per can. The sodium is low also. Very nice drink. I'll be getting more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I often pick up an evening meal at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and when I do I often select a beverage to go along with the meal. I might add that I enjoy trying things I've never had before. This time the beverage was Honest Tea / Honey Green Tea in a 16.9-ounce bottle. Please notice that my review is for the tea only. Whatever the cost per bottle is and the shipping costs are your own personal business. Personally, I don't buy heavy things like this that can be easily found nearby, but that may not apply to all people.<br /><br />This Honey Green Tea is quite good. Excellent! It has a very light  and pleasant green-tea taste and is just a tad sweet with honey, as they claim. It goes down real easily, believe me. I think I could pull down a whole bottle in one long swig, if I wanted to. But I enjoy sipping it in small amounts and savoring the excellent taste.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I pick up an evening meal at my nearby Fresh and Easy store quite often, especially during the summer. this evening it was a delicious salad. Plus, they had Kind Nuts and Spices bars on sale. They make good deserts. They're very low in sugar and have a good fiber and protein content,  not exactly your typical desert. Tonight I chose a Dark Chocolate, Nuts and Sea Salt bar. It was very good. Excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We tend (perhaps try would be a better word) not to have a lot of snacks around the house, mainly because we tend to eat them and they can add a lot of extra calories to a diet, if you're not careful. However, a few things seem necessary and we try to make those occasional treats relatively healthy, or at least relatively harmless. Thus it is that my wife found these Stretch Island Fruit Co \"Fruit Leathers\" in our local warehouse club store. It was the large variety pack, as is illustrated here.<br /><br />It was quite a sizable package, but we've gradually reduced them down to the last dozen or so and will shortly be getting another pack. We use them as snacks, pack them in my lunch, take them along camping and find other uses. Our boy is just starting to teethe, and I suppose he'll have fun with them. I rather like them as snacks except for the fact that they tend to stick to my teeth for a long time after eating. However, these \"Fruit Leathers\" are a tasty treat that's low in calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I read somewhere that chocolate is now good for you. I don't remember where. It was just one of those things that stuck in my mind. I suppose it's because I've always liked chocolate, and especially really dark chocolate. Oh, you know, in that article, it also said that the darker the chocolate, the better it was for you. Go figure. Well, it used to be that chocolate was bad because it had a high fat content, but these days it seems that there's bad fat and good fat and chocolate has the good kind. Plus, this chocolate (70% Cacao content) is organic, not the ordinary kind. Modern nutrition is marvelous. Well, all of this came to mind as I strolled by the candy rack in a nearby Fresh and Easy Market where I was grocery shopping and this Green and Black's Dark Organic Chocolate Bar (3.5 ounces) was impossible to pass by. Did I mention that this bar is really tasty? Here's to my good health!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife is Russian and knows a lot of European friends. Recently, we had a birthday party for our 2-year-old boy and somebody brought a packet of 8 Kinder Chocolate Bars, probably knowing that my wife preferred European candies to most American ones. These Kinder Bars were made in Poland. They are much less sweet than American candies. An individual bar is about 2 inches long and about a half inch wide. It is further subdivided into smaller bites. I can't tell you how many because they're all gone. Yum. Externally, they're covered with chocolate and they have a white creamy center. It says a serving is two bars and that amounts to about 230 calories. Expect them to be hard to find, except internet places like Amazon.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here in California, we have an ongoing threat with natural disasters, and I'm thinking specifically of earthquakes. All electricity, natural gas, most communications and transportation could be out of order for unspecified times and It is advised that the populace ought to be prepared for such an event. Foodstuffs, water, batteries, temporary lighting and a variety of other provisions ought to be in supply to last at least a week. Well, no one can ever be totally prepared for a natural disaster, but I try to at least keep the food and drinkable water cabinet full. Fruits and veggies are real easy in canned or dried forms. Nuts, dried foods of other kinds and crackers are a snap. Good sources of protein are another matter and a little more difficult. Here I've gone with a number of canned items and one such item is Kirkland Signature Roast Beef in Beef Broth which comes in four-can packets and which I get at my local Costco warehouse store. It's fairly economical and easy to use. It's rather tasty for a canned meat product and can be eaton as is or cooked into a variety of meals. It's vary low in fat and consists of chunks of top and bottom round. It's fully cooked, but might be heated if you like. Now and then, in non-emergency times, I use a can so that there is a gradual turnover. Plus, I like to take a can or two along  when I go on camping trips. It suits these purposes well and I'm very satisfied with this product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been shopping the gourmet and international isle of my local grocery store lately. I guess it must be out of boredom for the regular things I have in my diet. In any case, I've found some real interesting things. Here's one: Zatarains Creole Mustard. Mmmmm. good! It's not overly hot and is about the same as my regular Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard, but it has a different mix of spices that give it a fresh new flavor. I can't see anything in the ingredients that would make it stand out so, but it does and I'm hard placed to describe the flavor. Perhaps the secret is in the vinegar. It's a brown mustard and is somewhat coarsely ground. Quite good!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Yesterday, I went in for a supplies  restocking at a nearby Costco and picked up a few very interesting products. One was a 32-ounce jar of Mezzetta Napa Valley Bistro Italian Olive Antipasto marinated with fresh garlic, herbs and Nappa Valley chardonnay. It appears to be exactly the same product as listed here but my jar appears to be larger. In any case, this product is just excellent! The taste is sensational! Thank goodness it's a low calorie dish! It's a mixture of olives, green peppers, onions, chunks of fresh garlic and it's all marinated in wonderful herbs, sea salt, canola oil, distilled vinegar and Napa Valley Chardonnay. The marination sauce is so good I plan to save it, filter out the herbs and drink the remaining juice. It has good electrolites, plus a wonderful taste. Mmmmm. This stuff is wonderful!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. They're a British company and a lot of their items (other than store brands) are imported from England and elsewhere in Europe. One such item I discovered was Heinz Potato and Leek Soup in 14.1-ounce cans. Boy is this stuff good! You don't taste the salt, but it's a bit higher in sodium than I'd like. It has fairly low fat content and no trtans fats. The protien content is low so you'd probably want to serve it as a side dish to a meal. But it would make a wonderful side dish, that's for certain. The soup has a nice creamy texture with little square pieces of potato (about 1/4 inch on a side) floating in the creamy  sauce. The potatoes are done to perfection. Mmmmmm. This is just a wonderful soup.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We always keep a supply of cereal bars around for our little boy (4 years old). His eating can be somewhat erratic  and there are times when I don't think he's getting enough to eat and he refuses to eat anything else. Well, I can almost always get him to eat a good cereal bar. I've bee using the Fresh and Easy bars and they're quite good and the boy likes them. Well, this time, they had a small display of Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bars and they were on a deep discount sale. I bought a couple including this blueberry variety. The bars are quite good. Nice and fresh and flavorful. They certainly didn't last long with the boy. They'll do. Nice mix of ingredients too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's a quite good drink that I picked up at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market It's Aloe Gloe (Crisp Aloe) Pulp-Free Aloe water. It has a nice light, somewhat fruity, only slightly sweet flavor and is quit good tasting and very refreshing. It test out at only 35 calories per 15.2-ounce container, so is very low in calories. It's certified organic, gluton free, and provides a variety of health benefits as listed on the side panel. Plus, it's delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Somewhere along the line my toddler got introduced to marshmellows. Perhaps it was due to the fact that my wife uses them in cooking with a few items, sweet potatoes come to mind. In any case, I started using them as little rewards when the boy would do something right, as desert after a meal and as a sprinkling of things in his cereal. He just loves marshmellows. I try to keep the \"candy\" content of his diet down to a minimum, so I switched over to the smaller miniature marshmellows. He barely noticed. In any case the Kraft brand is excellent. They're nice and tasty and fresh. Perhaps with the next pack I'll try some of the flavored varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy trying new foods and beverages. I found this \"Aloe gloe\" water (crisp, original, pulp free) in a 15.2-ounce bottle in my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I had to try it. I've never had anything aloe before and I was curious. Well, it's quite good. I'd say it tastes like a mild iced tea with something of a fresh, very-light minty flavor and is ever so slightly sweet. All the ingredients are certified organic. It's produced right here in California, only about a hundred miles away, in fact. Supposedly it has digestive, immune and skin benefits, and I certainly can't vouch for that after having only one bottle. But, I like it. Nice taste. Goes  down easy. Only 70 calories in a 2-serving bottle. I'll be back for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our son (one year old) now eats solid foods. What should we give him? Well, the doctor says he can have anything we eat, as long as he can handle it. OK. When we eat, he eats some of our stuff. He loves going to the neighborhood frozen yogurt shop, that's for sure. He enjoys refried beans in many Mexican places. He loved my split-pea soup with ham. Apple sauce is one of his favorite foods. When we go to the In 'n' Out Burger, he loves the french fries and parts of the burger, and I hesitate even to mention the chocolate shakes. Yum!<br /><br />In addition, my wife has picked up a variety of more traditional baby foods and many of those have been made by Gerber under the Graduates heading. This afternoon, he dined on one of the Graduates lil' entrees, specifically the Pasta Stars in Meat Sauce. This particular dining experience was an almost total failure. He ingested a couple spoons of the pasta sauce and then refused to eat any more. I gave him a few if the green beans. He took them in, a negative experience was recorded on his face and they came right back out. Hmmmmm. I wondered what the problem was. So, I took a spoon and ate the pasta sauce. It was bland and way overcooked but it didn't taste all that bad. I also ate the beans. They were severely overcooked. Both parts of the entree were cooked to the point where they resembled some type of mush. Well, after dining on french fries and hamburgers, no wonder he winces at these entrees. He needn't worry any more. He won't be getting any further Gerber's lil' entrees. My wife also noted that they were packaged in a #7 plastic container and she said she'd serve them no longer. Not all is bad about the Graduates items, however, our son loves the Crunchies and Wagon wheels.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This noon for lunch I had a box of Dr. McDougall's Garden Vegetable Soup (lower sodium variety. It was quite good. The box contained two servings and only 60 calories each.I consumed both servings. Plus, it had no fat and, of course, the sodium was low. It was a good tasting soup and, together with a couple other items, made a good nutritious lunch.<br /><br />I like to find items like this because I can store  them in my pantry and have a good meal prepared in no time at all. Plus, I worry about proper nutrition and so many of the things you can store are so high in salt, sugar and fat. Not here! This is a good item. I've also enjoyed their lentil soup and I'll probably test a few other kinds. You wouldn't think such good soups would come in a box.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've tried a few of the Imagine organic soups and I've enjoyed two different flavors (tomato and mushroom). Today, I tried something new. I boiled up a mixture of organic baby carrots and celery slices and included a thinly sliced Italian sausage. Added to it were a chicken bouillon cube, some black pepper, four bay leaves, some garlic salt and a sprinkling of dill weed. I boiled the mixture until ready to eat. It tasted quite good in itself. Then I added about 8 pounces of the Imagine creamy Butternut Squash soup to the mixture and heated it up again. Oh my, what a nice soup! This stuff was just terrific! I'm sure you could make up a lot of your own mixtures equally good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "From time to time my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has displays of items that are on sale, perhaps because they are being discontinued. Sometimes, the items were never carried in the store in the first place, as was the case here. So, here were some packs (boxes) of six bars of Chex Mix Treats of the Chocolate Chunk variety. They were at a 50% discount. How could I resist?<br /><br />The individual bars are 1.06 ounces and weigh in at 120 calories. They're mostly made of cereal but have added chunks of chocolate. They're quite good tasting and make a nice snack. I get them primarily for my little boy (4 years old) as a snack and as an \"incentive\" type of thing. He loves them, of course, and they have some nutritional value in addition to being a treat. I might judge them to be a little high on the candy content.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Way back when I was a little kid (perhaps 65 years ago) my Dad used to bring home a coconut on occasion. It was a family affair. He'd punch a hole in it and drain the juice and all five of us would have a little sip. Then he's break the shell with a hammer and we'd all have a bit of coconut meat. I remember it as a fun childhood experience. Well, I can't recall having coconut ever since, except as an ingredient in candy or cookies.<br /><br />Recently, I was visiting a local grocery store and I noticed Amy & Brian Coconut Juice In the beverage section. It was billed as a natural isotonic unsweetened beverage and was 100& coconut water. Hmmm. Just like the old days, but now it comes in a pop-top 17.5-ounce can. Well, I had to try it, of course. Well, nostalgia isn't what it used to be. It was an okay beverage, but I wouldn't put it among my  favorites. The flavor is mild and non-sweet. It goes down easily. The calories are limited (120 per can). It states that it's an isotonic beverage good before or after exercise and it states that it has potassium and magnesium, but doesn't list the amount. Be sure to drink it  chilled. I'd drink it again, but I'm not rushing out to get more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I was looking through the Asian section of my local grocery store and found 6-ounce bottles of Sushi Chef Pickled Ginger. I love this stuff in Asian Restaurants, and I'm thinking mostly of Japanese food.  Well, these bottles are not nearly as good. They seem to lack the crisp taste and zest of ginger. Plus, they have kind of a yellowish color, particularly up against the bottle margin, rather than the pink color I associate with ginger. I'm wondering if I didn't get a jar that had aged too long on the shelf. There is no expiration date on the bottle, I might add. Alas, I was happy to find this, but I will not be purchasing it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a package of Nonni's Biscotti Cioccolati in an individually-wrapped 8-pack box for my wife. She loves stuff like this. Alas, she's been on a diet and refuses to eat any. One wouldn't hurt her but she's afraid of finishing off the box. They're rather good, I might indicate. They're individually hard bread (topped with nuts) slices and are bottomed with a veneer of tasty dark chocolate. A serving (one biscuit) amounts to 110 calories, so I can understand her worries. Well, what are you gonna do? You can't just throw away stuff this good. I ate them. It was a tough job, but somebody had to do it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I can be somewhat lazy and I've discovered that my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a wide variety of prepared meals all made up and ready to go. Typically, all that needs to be done is to heat them in the microwave. Now, does this appeal to a lazy person? Oh, yes, and as you take your item to the register, there's a wide variety of drinks on display. Tonight, I had Chicken Alfredo (quite good) and a 16-ounce bottle of Hubert's Strawberry Lemonade to go with it. The lemonade came to about 120 calories for the whole bottle and it was sweetened (lightly) with cane sugar. The taste was light and pleasant. Nice drink!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have a couple cats. One is three, the other is four. Both are very nice pets to have around the house. We feed our cats partly soft food and partly pellets. Both foods are of a somewhat expensive prescription variety because of a urinary tract blockage one of the cats developed. The cats do not seem to particularly like the food. Given the choice, they'd take Trader Joe's tuna. However, day after day, it's the same old same old. Do the cats get bored? Well, they don't show it if they do. But we try to add a few minor treats from time to time, just in case. My wife found these Kitty Kaviar things at a local pet store. Well, they smell disgusting. Somewhat like an aging fish market. However, the cats are just delighted with the treat and each small sample supplied seems to disappear almost instantly. It's an interesting product and the cats love it!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I love cheddar cheese crackers and Cheez-Its comes immediately to mind. I just can't resist them, so I resist buying them. It works, except I break down every now and then. I've enjoyed them ever since I was a kid back in the fifties. More recently, my four-year-old boy was introduced to Gold Fish by the grandparents and he simply loves them, especially the colored variety. I can't get through the grocery store without picking up a bag. Well, Gold Fish are quite good, but, in my opinion, they don't mark up to Cheez-Its.<br /><br />Recently, when visiting a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, I spotted another item. It was Annie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Snack Mix in a 5-ounce box. The mix was partly small cheese crackers in the shape of bunnies and partly small salted pretzels. Very nice and tasty. They have a distinct taste which is provided by some type of seasoned salt. Very good. I'd say the crackers are more like Gold Fish than Cheez-Its, and I'd say that the Cheez-Its are better, but these are quite good. The pretzels add a bit, of course, so I'm going to have to find a box of crackers-only to make a true comparison. I haven't tried them out on my little boy as yet because when I opened the box, I just finished them all off. Well, that's my experience with cheddar-cheese crackers.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "From time to time I make up a dish, particularly chicken, that needs a little extra flavoring zest so I keep these Knorr's chicken bouillon cubes in the spice rack. I used one just the other day for a chicken with rice soup. They're quite high in sodium so when I use them I don't use additional salt. Good product. it will keep practically forever. I'm not certain why I have the Spanish version. It was just whar the store stocked.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I had toast with my eggs this morning. And on that toast, I had a spreading of the James Leiller DUNDEE Ginger Preserve. Excellent! I might wish it would spread a bit easier and it seems to be quite high in calories. Those are very minor criticisms. If you like ginger, this stuff is really, really good. I discovered this preserve after being aquainted with the Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade. It was just so good I had to try some of their other things. The Ginger Preserve was one, and yes, it's simply outstanding!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Last week I bought a big jar of \"Famous Dave's Signature Spicy Pickle Chips\" at my nearby Costco Warehouse Store. Now, to be completely honest, the jar was 64 ounces, whereas the offer here is for a pack of three 24-ounce jars. However, it's exactly the same product. Only the container(s) is different.<br /><br />These pickles are just sensational! My, oh my! They're crisp and crunchy, much moreso than most jarred pickles. And they're nice and spicy. I'd say they were spicy much like most \"bread and butter\" pickles, but these are the best I've ever had. They're somewhat like sweet pickles, but nowhere nearly as sweet. I'd say, it's somewhat of a cross, and a delicious one at that. They taste very good while eating and have a nice fresh peppery aftertaste. My goodness! I've just never had better pickles that I can remember. This probably seems like a lot of hype. Well, let me know what you think. Hopefully, they'll become available soon via Amazon. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always preferred coffee to tea, but I'm aware of the many claimed health benefits of green tea. My wife is Russian and prefers tea, but she drinks Earl Gray and types like that and doesn't care for green tea. Well, we were strolling through our local Costco Warehouse store and a lady offered us a small cup of green tea. We both took one. I thought it was quite good. My wife said it was the best green tea she had tasted. We walked away from the little display with a packet of Kirkland Signature Green Tea (100 bags).<br /><br />Now, what are we ever going to do with all this tea? Well, we use it bit by bit and the supply is gradually lowering. Guests take it and it seems to please them all. I'm trying to drink it now and then for increasing my anti-oxidents. Hmmmm. Maybe I'll eventually be a tea lover. In any case, this is an excellent green tea.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of \"Beetlejuice\" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, \"Beetlejuice\" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "While lately at my Fresh and Easy  store, a British company, I picked up some imported (from England) Fox's Crunch Creams ginger cookies in  the 200g packet. Mmmmm. These are delicious!. The cookie part is very fresh and crunchy and the interior has a creamy ginger flavor, but is not too sweet. A serving amounts to two cookies and that's 150 calories with 72 of them as fat, so I'm going to have to watch myself. That'll be hard to do. These things are delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "In shopping at a nearby Costco yesterday, I came across some Kirkland Signature Artichoke Hearts marinated in oil. Man, are they ever good! Incredible! Well, I just had to review this item and tell people about it. So I tried to look it up on the Amazon computer. Well, it isn't there. I found all kinds of artichoke hearts, but no Kirkland Signature. However, in sorting through this assortment, I think I found the same thing by the same manufacturer. Okay, Kirkland Signature is a Costco store brand. They don't manufacture  their items. They contract out to have other companies put stuff up for them. Well, I'm certain these Cara Mia Marinated Artichoke Hearts are the exact same thing as the Kirkland. The  giveaway is  the bottle and the cap on the bottle. The cap has two thin green lines running around the base, in exactly the same way as the Kirkland. Strangely, the Cara Mia bottle is labeled as 62 ounces and it must be a mistake. The exact same Kirkland bottle is 33 ounces. So, I think I'm right on this matter and it's a exceptionally quality item. Like to take a gamble?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I bought a jar of James Keiler Dundee Three-Fruit Marmalade at my nearby Fresh and Easy Store. They're an English company and have a lot of things imported from England. Well, that was a really good marmalade! My goodness! It was so good that the next time I was there I bought two other kinds of the same brand: Ginger Preserves and Dundee Key Lime Marmalade. Both are excellent, but this Key Lime stuff is just sensational! I had no idea marmalade could be so delicious. My neighbor tells me that marmalades are a British speciality. I believe her! It sure beats Smuckers!<br /><br />This stuff is just plain good. It has a nice crisp and fresh lime taste. It goes real well on toast and I have to be careful not to eat too much. Everyone who tastes it, loves it. Why haven't I heard of this before?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I seem to eat a lot of jerky. I have it as snacks or as te meat course with quickly prepared lunch-type meals. It's good, will mix with almost any other snack-type foods and is low in fat. I get the jerky in large bags at a nearby Costco Wholesale store. This time I picked up a 14.5-ounce bag of Golden Island Pork Jerky Korean Barbecue Recipe. It's good. Real good. Nice smoky flavor. Slightly sweet. The meat is rather dry but easy to chew and the barbecue sauce is somewhat moist. A one-ounce serving is only 92 calories and has 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Dried fruits and nuts constitute a fairly good portion of my diet. Thus, when I was on the latest visit to my nearby Costco Warehouse store, I spotted a display of Philippine Brand Dried Coconut. I've had the dried mangoes from this brand and they were quite good. Into the basket went an 18-ounce packet of coconut. Dried coconut is not one of my favorites, but mix it with other things and it can be quite good and good for you. For example, I read that one serving supplies 14 g of fiber, or 55 % of your daily needs. That's amazing! And with only a small amount of sodium.<br /><br />This dried coconut is a bit like eating candy, except it only has a trace of sugar and is only slightly sweet. But it chews up like a candy and is quit tasty in a very mild way. I think my young boy thinks it is candy and that's a neat trick to have around. It's good and good for you. What more could you expect from a treat?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of shopping in a Fresh and Easy Market that is located nearby. They're a British company and stock a lot of foods from England and other parts of Europe. They're always a little bit different than American foods and I enjoy trying them out. One such latest item is Heinz Beans with Tomato Sauce. Now, you'd think beans would be beans no matter where they're produced but, man, these beans are delicious and well worth the slight extra cost. I guess you'd say they were gourmet beans. The beans themselves are done to perfection and they're drenched in a savory, rich tomato sauce. Real nice flavor! What can I say? These are about the best canned beans I can recall. And nutritionally, beans are an excellent food. They have zero fat, a good protein content and lots of fiber for those of you who worry about regularity. Mostly, I just love beans and these are real good beans!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Lately, I've been trying a few different brands of coconut water drinks which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. I find them quite refreshing and I like the high potassium content to balance the sodium in my diet. Well, tonight there was a new bran and it came in six packs of 10-ounce cans: Amy & Brian Coconut Juice. Hmmm, the others are listed as coconut water. Well, I had to try it. the can says all natural and lists young coconut water as the only ingredient. Strangely enough, the ingredients don't list the potassium content, a usual bragging matter for coconut drinks. Well, this coconut juice tastes somewhat sweet and a bit rich. In a slight way, it's almost a bit candy-like. It's a good juice, but I don't like it as well as several of the other lighter brands which I would regard as more refreshing. Probably, I won't be buying a second six pack. Some people may prefer the taste, so don't let my taste deter you.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "The Fresh and Easy Store where I shop for groceries is restocking a small desert section with imported goodies and I just can't resist trying all the new items. One is Gamesa Vanilla Sugar Wafers imported from Mexico. They come in a 6.7 ounce packet. The wafers are ultra light  and delicious. i bought the vanilla variety, but I'll be back for others. The whole wafer part consists of three layers of thin wafers inter-layered with two thin layers of a vanilla creme. They're light and crunchy. The flavor is mild, light and fresh tasting and they practically melt in your mouth. Mmmm. Good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, a company that has only recently invaded the southern California grocery business. It's an English company and they feature a lot of British and European things that you probably wouldn't find in most American stores. One of the things they feature is a variety of British candies. My wife tells me that European candies are better than American and I think she's right. In any case, I discovered where they keep the British candies away from the regular candies and in the baking section of the store so I'm trying them out, but only one bar at a time and only on the day I go shopping. This trip, I bought a Yorkie Original chocolate bar. Mmmmmm! Is it good! The flavor goes far beyond the typical American chocolate bar. Simply delicious! What else can I say? I suppose you'd have to discover this by yourself but if you ever get a chance, give it a try. Make sure it's imported from England and is marked ORIGINAL. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our 11-month-old boy is going through his teething stage (4 uppers and 2 lowers, so far). We're now feeding him a mixture of foods some of which we get in the store and some of which we make ourselves. Some of his foods just come off of our plates. One of the store products we use are the Gerber 2nd Foods meats. They come in chicken, beef and lamb. For some reason our boy doesn't particularly like like the chicken, so we've mostly used the beef and lamb. The lamb is harder to find.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how fast the kid will go through baby food. We seem to be running to the store all the time. Well, this time, in order to simplify my life somewhat, I just got a 12-jar pack. This helps. He likes it, so there will be no problem with ending up with a bunch of stuff he won't eat. Plus we supplement it with a variety of other foods. Personally, I'd rather feed him more of the stuff we prepare ourselves, but our lives are just too complicated.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Upon strolling the snack food isles of my local Costco Warehouse store, I discovered a huge plastic jar (44 ounces) of UTZ Pub Mix, an assortment of bite-sized salty snack items. Some resembled small crackers, some resembled small straight pretzels, some were cheese flavored, and some were like small rye bread wafers. The only thing they all had in common is that they were all fresh, tasty and, in fact, delicious. The salting is very light, which I prefer, and there's a nice assortment of tastes associated with the different types. They refer to it as a Pub Mix and, indeed, that would be an excellent usage.<br /><br />I'll use this delicious mixture as snacks around the house. The boy (3 years) loves them too. If we ever have a gathering this would make an excellent beginning snack. I could just empty this big 44-ounce jar into a good-sized bowl and, viola, snacks for everyone. Of course, a few other finger-food items might be added. These are gonna work out just fine. And that big jar can be sealed tight to preserve the freshness of any leftovers. Why didn't I notice them before?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been using Icebreakers as a breath freshener for some time now. Almost by accident, I gave one to my little boy (3.5 years) when he saw me taking one. He immediately liked it and would ask for one from time to time. Okay, they're only a tiny piece of candy and they're sugar free. What harm could it do? Well, then I started using them as little rewards and small incentives to do things. It worked. Finally, one day when I ran out and wanted to pick up some more, I found the Ice Breakers Sours (Mixed Berry) and I started using them. At first, he seemed startled at the drastic change in flavor. Now he loves them, more than the mint. Well, I like them too. I still prefer the mint as a breath freshener, but these little Sours are my boy's favorites.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.\n",
      "I found this very large bag (4 pounds) of Kirkland Signature California Pistachios at my local warehouse store and I couldn't resist. Mmmmmm. Pistachios are one of my favorite nuts. And they have some health benefits too, or at least that's what I tell myself as they go into the shopping cart. These pistachios are excellent. Lightly salted. Nice and fresh. Good roasted flavor. What more could you ask for in a healthy snack? This huge bag won't last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife and I were shopping at a nearby \"Fresh and Easy\" grocery store and she spotted PG Tips black tea on the shelves in the beverage isle. She has lived in London and recognized it immediately as one of the top British teas. She says that she seldom has seen it in America, but there it was. Well, \"Fresh and Easy\" is a British company, so it figures. Of course, we had to pick up an 80-bag box.<br /><br />My wife loves this stuff and I'd have to rate it rather good. I might add that I much prefer coffee as a beverage but I enjoy tea now and then. I must admit that this tea is much more robust than that with which I'm familiar, mainly Lipton. My wife loathes Lipton, and after trying this tea I can see a substantial difference. Lipton now tastes like slightly flavored hot water to me whereas PG has a good robust flavor. Most certainly, I won't drink Lipton again with a choice of tea like PG Tips around.<br /><br />We also like the little pyramid tea bag. I think it contains much more tea than the conventional flat paper bag, and perhaps that in itself promotes the more robust flavor. In any case, this is most certainly an excellent tea and we'll eventually be back for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well it was time once again to visit the grocery store and the prime item to pick up was at more cat food. Boy, the stuff really goes fast! I have two cats and both are neutered males. One (Boo) is about five years old and the other (The Fuzz) is about six. Both will gobble up any kind of cat food and eat as much of it as they can get. They're not fussy eaters at all. However, there's one problem. Boo has a condition that requires an expensive prescription food (Hills Prescription Diet C/D Multicare) or he develops little crystals in his urinary tract and that requires the expensive services of a vet. The Fuzz, on the other hand, will gobble down any kind of cat food you give him and beg for more.  However, I question giving him the same thing over and over, or even the same brand. As such, I switch around through about a half-dozen kinds my nearby store has to offer. This time I picked up a 3.15 pound bag of Friskies Seafood Sensations containing four seafood flavors plus a bit of seaweed. I gave it a first try with The Fuzz this evening. As predicted, it was gobbled right down, just like any other cat food I feed him. Evidently, the people at pet food manufacturing companies have it down as to exactly what like to eat. I might be concerned about their long-term health. However, The Fuzz has been 100% healthy on his dry catfood diet so. He loves the new Friskies Seafood Sensations, I should add. Please note that the product offered here is in a bag that is twice the size of that which I had purchased. I'd prefer this larger bag, but my neighborhood market doesn't offer it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I've been on a kick where I'm trying a lot of international foods to get away from the ordinary blahs of day-to-day living. I was strolling down the international isle of my local grocery store and spotted this Sun Luck Hot Chinese-Style Mustard Paste. That looked good! I've always liked the mustards in Asian restaurants and it seemed worth a try. It's good! Real nice strong mustard flavor. It's quite zesty, but not to the point where it takes your breath away. I'd judge it to be made up with an eye on American tastes. Well, it was just about perfect for me. I wish I had a few Asian friends to try it out on and get their opinions.,<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Gosh! What next? A 24-ounce bag of raw, shelled hemp seeds. Well, I've consumed a certain amount of hemp in my youth, but we threw the seeds away. Pity. They're rather good when prepared right, and these are well prepared. They're called Hemp Hearts and I  stumbled upon them at Costco. Rather interesting. These little gems are really packed with nutrients and the protein and fiber are way up there. Plus, would you believe, there's no sodium. Yeah, and they taste rather good too. I just like to eat them by the spoonful right out of the bag. Plus, I'll eventually I get around to sprinkling them on things also. Who'd have ever thunk? I wonder if you can smoke them?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "These dried mangos are excellent. I picked them up at Costco and was hesitant because the bag was so large. False problem. These Philippine Brand dried mangos are excellent. Perhaps they might be a little higher in sugar than I would like, but they really taste good. They're nice and chewy and have excellent, although highly variable from piece to piece, flavor. Good product. I'm down to the bottom of the bag and looking for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I just recently discovered that my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a variety of green teas. Wonderful! I was introduced to cold green tea about a year ago and I loved it. Now I can buy Teas' Tea Jasmine Green Tea quickly and easily. It's rather expensive, but soooo good! It's only ingredients are purified water, jasmine green tea and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The taste is light and utterly refreshing. I'd take this unsweetened tea over any kind of sweetened tea any time. After you get used to it, regular iced tea just will never suffice. I wonder how long it will be before this stuff starts appearing in restaurants. I haven't noticed any as yet. Believe me, it's only a matter of time.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Fortunately, I've never been gluten sensitive, at least as far as I know, but I've got a couple friends that are on gluten-free diets. This seems to be one of those things that wasn't even recognized a couple decades ago and now everyone seems to be worried about gluten. Gosh, I was at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market the other day and found that they even had a gluten-free section with all kinds of gluten-free products. I was amazed. I looked over the selection and decided to try a can of the Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup. I was very disappointed with the soup. First of all, the picture on the can shows an abundance of chicken and noodles. In reality, the broth is by far the main constituent of the can.  When you empty the entire can into a bowl, the chicken, noodles and vegetables don't even show. The chicken is somewhat dry, tough and woody and lacks good flavor. The noodles strike me as being badly overcooked, at least for my taste. The flavor of the broth is weak and the sodium content is high. Gosh, I had a can of this soup (not a very fulfilling meal) and took in about 60% of my daily value of sodium. I suppose this might be an appropriate item if you have gluten problems, but I don't. There are a lot better Chicken Noodle soups around if you aren't worried about the gluten problem.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked Trisquits. It goes way, way back, at least 70 years to my childhood. My mother always thought they were better for us than plain white saltine crackers. I think she was right. I like the saltyness, the flavor and the crunchy texture. Thus it was when I found some Triscuit Cracked Pepper and Olive Oil crackers (9.0-ounce box) at a nearby Fresh and Easy store. Oh, that sounded good. Well, they were! Excellent! All the good texture and flavor of the Standard Triscuit plus the bracing taste of fresh pepper with a little olive oil. Plus, they're a whole-grain product and have a lot of fiber. Good, good, good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been having a few of these noodle dishes and cups for lunch lately. They're all too high in sodium and too low in protein, but I have ways of countering this. Today I had the Maruchan Yakisoba Roast Chicken noodle dish. How easy! Just put water in it, add the ingredients as directed and in four minutes (plus a minute to cool down) and it's ready to go. I particularly liked this roast Chicken flavor for some reason. Yum. I'll be getting a few more of these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "When it comes to fine dining, our cats prefer Trader Joe's Tuna above all else. It's amazing! However, much though they might like it, we can't just feed them tuna day after day so we try to vary their diet by giving them other brands and other varieties of cat foods. Plus, we give them a couple small scoops of dry cat food every day. Of the things we give them, they seem to prefer the Fancy Feast brand of canned food so we pick up this variety pack. They seem to like everything in it. No food goes to waste, that's for certain. Now and then we add a couple other Fancy Feast variety packs. It seems to provide good choices. We've had no problems with them getting fussy and our cats have maintained excellent health<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy shopping at Costco and I can't seem to resist certain impulse items. This week I picked up a 33-ounce plastic bag of Lindsay Sliced California Ripe Olives. Now, what am I ever going to do with all these sliced olives? Well, they taste quite good so that will help. They can be used with a lot of other things or eaten as a snack. They'll keep for a long time in the fridge. I'll get good use of them, I'm sure.<br /><br />The olive slices come tightly sealed in a tough plastic bag. About 3/4 of the contents of the bag are the olive slices and the rest is a packing liquid just as you'd find in a jar. Be careful when you open the bag. You also might find a sealable container to put the contents in after you open the bag. Keeping them in the bag doesn't work too well. In any case, they're very good ripe olives and there's a lot of them. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "On the \"Specials\" shelf at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, I found a box (net wt. 8 ounces) of Ocean Spray Fruit Snacks. The box contained 10 smaller packets (0.8 ounces) of snacks made with real fruit juices and natural flavors and colors. Each of the packets contains about 8 pieces of  things that resemble Gummy Bears, but are softer and easier to chew. The flavors (Strawberry, Grape, Cherry and Mixed berry) are quite good. I guess one packet amounts to 80 calories and provides 100% of the daily vitamin C. Well, that's interesting. I thought they might be used as treats for my little boy (about 4-years old), and I think they'll do splendidly.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been on a diet and I've been looking for items that are high in taste but very low in calories. Furthermore I want them to be vegetarian. Not too long ago, I discovered Tillen farms pickled asparagus spears and found them to be excellent. When I went back for more, I found this jar of Tilllen Farms Crispy Snap Peas on the same shelf about a foot away. Hmmmm. Only 15 calories a serving. I couldn't get away without it. A good choice. The beans are delicious! Nice and fresh tasting with a nice snap when you bite into them. Good flavor. Just the thing I'm looking for.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This past week, I discovered some 16-ounce boxes of De Cecco Penne Regate pasta on the bargain shelves of my local grocery store. I'd never heard of the brand but it was imported from Italy  and I thought it would be worth a try. Oh my, this was a good pasta! In fact, it was one of the best I could remember. I boiled it about 15 minutes, then added a light olive oil coating plus some cheesy prepared tomato sauce and a liberal amount of sprinkled-on parmesan and a little bit of Frank's Hot Sauce to add a little zest. Mmmmm. Good! Well, the pasta boxes are now all gone from the bargain shelves, but I've got an additional box with spinach to open later. I'm going to have to remember this brand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Salt is salt. If you like, it's sodium chloride. Or, if you like, it occurs naturally as the mineral Halite (I'm a geologist, by the way). If it's pure, it's just sodium chloride and there's no reason to believe that one type of salt is any different than the other. Thus it is that I have looked at such gourmet products as \"Mediterranean Sea Salt\" with a great deal of skepticism, and especially when you note the exceptionally high prices associated with such products.<br /><br />Well, my wife obtained a grinder of Mediterranean Sea Salt and I got after her for such a needless expense. I tried it, of course, and I was amazed. The taste is superb, much better than regular salt. It's so bright and fresh and, ahem, salty. Just a little bit is all you need. How can this be? Are other commercial salts somehow contaminated with extraneous ingredients? In any case, give Mediterranean Sea Salt a try sometime and make up your own mind.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "In general, we try to keep sweets out of our household. It's not that we don't like sweets, it's that we do and they can add considerably to the daily calorie count. It's difficult. I can get along without deserts and sweet snacks, but my wife has a longing for them. She's European and considers a small desert to be an essential part of a meal. We both struggle a bit with our weight so go most meals desertless. Now and then something comes along to upset our rigid little format. In this case, our local warehouse store provided a couple-dollars-off coupon on a 54-bar packet of Kellog\"s Rice Krispies \"krispy marshmellow squares.\" Well, they're only 90 calories each so what harm could they do? Or so the discussion went. We ended up buying.<br /><br />These things are rather good. They're soft and sweet and provide a certain oral gratification. What the hey? One now and then isn't going to do much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy having a few snacks around, but I like to have something I can nutritionally justify. Well, on my last trip to Costco, I found a three-pound (48 oz,) plastic jar of Kirkland Signature Milk Chocolate Almonds. Well, the almonds are good food and the chocolate  contains a lot of anti-oxidents, doesn't it? Hmmmm. Maybe I ought to just try one batch of these. Mmmmm. They were excellent! Nice and fresh and good tasting. Yummy! I'm going to have to watch myself and not eat too many.<br /><br />In any case, I went to review these delicious little wonders and couldn't find any listed as Kirkland Signature, but I did find these Milk Chocolate Roasted Almonds (48 oz.) and the photograph looked exactly like my Kirkland Signature ones.  In fact, if you then read down into the description, you find that they are Kirkland Signature. And if you read some of the reviews you find that they have been repackaged into a plastic bag. What goes? I have no idea. I'll rate the product as very good and give it five stars. I'll let you buyers decide on what to do.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked beef jerky as a snack. Turkey Jerky too. And a friend of mine made Venison jerky after hunting season and it was delicious too. It's a good snack and it has a high protein content, which is hard to find in a snack product. About the only things I don't like is that some jerky can be slightly rancid and some is way too salty.<br /><br />On my latest trip to my local Costco Warehouse store, I found \"Kirkland Signature Steak Strips.\" it's a jerky made of thick-cut top round steak and is 98% fat free. I can't recall ever finding a lower fat content in a jerky, and that means that the calorie content as well as the cholesterol is lower. These strips of beef are preserved with a delicious seasoning mix including brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and hicory smoke flavor. Real good! It says to refrigerate after opening and that's exactly what I'm doing to ensure the original freshness. Mmmmm. I have the feeling that these won't last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I found an interesting product at my local Costco Warehouse store. It's cans of Kirkland Signature premium chunk chicken breast packed in water. The individual cans are 12.5 ounces and the entire packet is six cans. I couldn't resist. I like to have things like this in the pantry because they can yield almost instant meals without the need to run to the market. Today, for example, I made up a batch of chicken with rice soup using a can of this chicken along with the seasoned water packing, some cut up baby carrots, celery and a brown/wild rice mixture plus a few spices from the kitchen cabinet. The whole thing was done in an hour and made up a delicious meal. So easy. Tasted great. Economical, too.<br /><br />This is excellent chicken and will lend itself to all kinds of dishes. It's tender and tasty and has a nice chunky appearance. It comes with a little starter recipe book and improvisations are welcome and easy. It's an excellent addition to my pantry.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago (within the last month) I picked up a couple cans of Progresso soups to have on my shelves in the event that I might need a quick and simple lunch. Today, I had a can of the Rich and Hardy Chicken Pot Pie Style. Well, it looked so tempting on the shelf, but I was somewhat disappointed. It was somewhat bland and flavorless and seemed starchy, Then I noticed the sodium. Way up there. That can of soup was two-thirds of my daily intake. Too much. I'm going to have to read my labels more carefully.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I shared a can of Amy's Organic Chili (Medium) with my boy (3.5 yrs old) for lunch. We had some corn bread crackers with it and a drink (him chocolate milk, me iced tea). The chili was very good, much better than I'm used to coming from a can (14.5 ounces). It cost a bit more but I think it was well worth it. The flavor was excellent. The meat was finely ground and was somewhast granular within the sauce rather than in little chunks of beef. The fat content was fairly low and there was little oil evident when the can was opened, quite unlike other available canned chili. The sodium content was alittle higher than I like, but not bad. The chili had lots of good fiber. It was ever-so slightly spicy, but not nearly as much as the hotter variety. The chili formed a good quality meal and I'll be back for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy a few snacks and deserts, but I try to keep such things healthy. That is, it has to taste good and be satisfying in that sense, but it also has to add essential ingredients to my total diet and not just empty calories. Of course, the problem with most snacks, candy and chips etc., is that they only add empty calories. They might taste good but they're high on fat, sugar and salt and low on everything else, including fiber. The problem with healthy snacks is that they tend not to be any good. It's tough. Well I found yet another item, and that is Leclerc Praeventia Dark Chocolate Cookies. They're little somewhat dry, flat, heart-shaped cookies with a rich chocolate taste. They say the chocolate is 70% cocoa. Plus, they're whole grain and contain a goodly source of fiber and no negative ingredients, such as trans-fats. Plus there's a long list of other impressive ingredients. Well, they also taste pretty good. I even give a few to my little boy (3 1/2) and if he eats them that's a good test. He does. If I had any complaint, it's that they're rather dry. Just counter that with having something to drink nearby.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I became aware of Panda Licorice only a short time ago. It's just an excellent licorice, one of the best I can remember. As such, I tried to get another box of it at my local super market which has a rather nice assortment of candies. Well, they had a space for it but it was all sold out. It figures. In any case, next to the place was a few boxes of Panda Licorice Flavored with Herbs. So, I tried it.<br /><br />Wow! This stuff is really good. It's just Panda Licorice, but with an assortment of 18 different herbal extracts added. I don't recognize most of them on the list. One that stands out is peppermint leaves and you can imagine what that tastes like along with licorice. In any case, if you like good licorice, give this a try. You might be surprised.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We buy this Starbucks Frappuccino Coffee Drink by the case at our local warehouse store. We don't drink it very often, but it makes a nice occasional treat. Rather, we like to have it around for others. When it comes time to offer our guests something to drink, the Frappuccino coffee drink is one of the many choices. Everyone who takes it seems to like it and an amazing number of people seem to like coffee drinks, plus Starbucks is such a well-known name. Personally, I find the Starbucks Frappuchino and other coffee drinks a little rich and much too sweet tasting. When it comes to coffee, I prefer my coffee brewed hot, black and strong, and Starbucks is an excellent coffee. My wife, on the other hand, prefers tea to coffee. Both she and I enjoy the Starbucks Frappuccino on rare occasions and we prefer drinking it ice cold. This is a good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "San Diego tap water smells a bit and leaves a lot of white crud in the glass if evaporated dry. But, what the hey? Why should I buy supplemental minerals if Colorado River water already contains a good variety? In any case, the city says it's safe and I know of no problems. Well, my wife feels differently about such matters. She's from Europe and nobody there supposedly drinks tap water. Disgusting. Drinking water must come in a bottle and be collected from some important and well-known springs. Besides, she seems to have elevated senses in taste, smell, sight, hearing and all other senses. In any case, to keep peace in the household, I agreed that we would drink bottled water. We gradually settled in on Kirkland Signature bottled water. The price was right! Well, now even that isn't good enough. My wife seems to have discovered Fiji Natural Artesian Water which comes in attractive rectangular bottles and is imported all the way from the South Pacific. It costs several times as much as regular brands, but that's part of the appeal. It's the best, she claims. It's so smooth and goes down so easy, she says. Now other bottled waters, although OK, are not nearly as good. No, Fiji Natural Artesian Water is the water for her. I must admit that it's excellent, but the cost is way too high.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I had a simple lunch today. It consisted of  a 10.5-ounce serving (one can) of Bar Harbor New England Style Lobster Bisque and a couple pumpkin seed cheddar crispbreads. Very good, and just the right size. The Lobster Bisque was excellent. Nice flavor and nice mix of ingredients, including the minced lobster, of course. I've been trying out the Bar Harbor seafoods of late and they're quite excellent, as was this lobster bisque. It's a little high in fat and cholesterol so I'll watch the intake on my other foods of the day. The sodium is a bit high too. Alas, if something is really good, you can just bet it overindulges in the wrong ingredients.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "On my last trip to the local Costco store, I picked up a 15-ounce bag of Sahale Snacks Pomegranate Pistachios Nut Blend. I hadn't noticed it before. Must be a new item. In any case, it represented a strange mixture of pistachios, pomegranates, almonds, cherries and seasoned with black pepper. Strangely enough, it was quite good. Delicious! Good nutrition, too. This won't last long! The calories are a little high, probably from the fat  content, but I should indicate that it's the good unsaturated fat. The sodium is a little high, but the fiber content is high also and that's good. It's an unusual but good tasting mix.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "The other day I purchased a 12-bottle case of Vintage Soda that I found at Costco and reviewed it. The selling point was that each of the four brands (Dad's Root Beer, Bubble Up, Nesbit's Orange and Nu Grape Soda) are made with cane sugar, rather than high fructose corn syrup and, as such resemble the good old fashioned drinks we used to enjoy. Well, they're excellent! Very good tasteing1<br /><br />A day later, while looking it up again, I discovered this case of \"All American Vintage Soda.\" Well, it's thew same thing. Same brands, same manufacturer. Everything is the same except the brand name and the box that they're in. I'm bringing this up because if you can't find one (Vintage Soda Variety Pack), you might be able to find the other (All America Vintage Soda).<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Today I undertook an expedition to a nearby Costco and picked up a stock of things for the pantry. One was  a case of Amy's Organic soups and tonight I had a big bowl of Lentil Vegetable. It was good. Nice aroma, right out of the can as it was opened. Also smelled good in the microwave. The taste was a little bland and seemed as if it could use a little salt. That's okay. Prepared soups almost always have way too much sodium and the content of this soup was acceptable. It was  a good soup and was loaded with fiber and had a goodly protein content. Nice soup.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "From time to time my wife brings home a jar of Nutella. I like it, but only on rare occasion. The flavor is just too overpowering for me and I tire of it quickly. My wife loves the stuff on bread (toast) or crackers and she eats it with her afternoon or evening tea. She raves about the chocolatey-nutty flavor and can't understand why I don't see things the same way. Such is life. In any case, if it pleases her, I'm happy with it. Oh, I might add that the baby seems to like it too. That's two out of three.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We picked up a large bottle (45 ounces) of KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce (Original) at our local warehouse store. Our idea was to use it on things done on our little backyard barbecue grill. It has worked well on chicken, beef and pork items. Plus we've cooked with it and used it as a topping, much like you might use ketchup, on beans, meat and a variety of other items. We love the tangy, smoked, woody taste. Ours is an overly large bottle for our needs for we use it only on rare occasions, but it keeps well in the fridge.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "When I order something simple in a Mexican restaurant (taco, burrito, etc.) I like to get a side order of \"hot carrots\" to go with it. They're delicious and supply veggies to go along with the main dish. Well, I always thought the restaurants made up the carrots themselves, but all of a sudden I was surprised to find you could buy big cans of them in a grocery store. This 26-ounce can of Embasa Carrots (in escabeche) is an example that I found in my local grocery store. Of course, I bought it. It's a good product. The carrots, onion and pepper strips are fully within the range of that which is served in Mexican restaurants. They're hot, but not unreasonably hot. The taste is excellent. This is a great discovery for me. I love these things and now I'll have a good home supply always available.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife and I have been trying to eliminate snacks of the junk variety from the house. It's impossible, of course. One thing we try to do is limit our snacks and have snacks around that carry some nutritional value. One such item are these little packets of Sun-Maid Natural California Raisins. An individual pack is low in calories, tasty and high in nutrition. We use them for all sorts of things and I carry them to work in my noontime lunch. In addition, they're excellent to take along on camping trips. Now and then a recipe turns up that requires a small amount of raisins and one or two of these little boxes often fill the bill. These are handy things to have in the pantry.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Valentina Salsa Picante, a Mexican hot sauce, suddenly appeared on the shelves in my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and I just had to try it. Well, it's quite good. The sauce has a quite nice, zesty taste without overwhelming heat. It reminds me of some of the better Cajun hot sauces and somewhat like Frank's Hot Sauce, but has it's own distinct flavor. It's imported from Mexico and is made in Guadalajara. Nice sauce. I initially tried it out on some California rolls and it went quite well. This stuff will be versatile. Trust me. I'll be using it on all sorts of things.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I always liked fruit cocktail as a kid and I especially liked it because there was always a cherry or two in every can. Well, now I find these little cups of Dole Cherry Mixed Fruit and I have a little boy of 3.5 years. Well. first of all, I enjoy the cups. There delicious and, yes, I still enjoy the cherries and the cherry taste of the whole cup. My boy likes them too. I can't communicate with him as to why, but the cups disappear in short order. Plus I like the fact that it's packed in fruit juice with no added sugar. These things work well in our house.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I shop at my nearby Fresh and Easy Grocery Market every once and a while and, while I'm there, I pick up a bit of their out-of-this-world candy. They keep in a special section of the store away from all of the more conventional candies. This candy is imported from England and, man, is it good! This trip's treat is a bar of Nestle Aero Milk Chocolate with a somewhat bubbly interior filling. It's the same bar as listed here and you'll probably note that even though they imply that it's from Canada, if you read the fine print is says it's from England. This stuff literally melts in your mouth (and all over your hands, I might add). My wife is from Russia and has lived in London and she claims that European chocolates are better than American. I would wholly agree. I've never tasted an American chocolate bar that was this good. Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife is from Europe (Russia mainly, but she's also lived in England) and she claims that European candies are better than American candies. She says that European candies are less sweet and more flavorful. From the ones I've tried, I'd have to agree. Funny, I'd never thought about it before. In any case, we live not to far from a Fresh and Easy market. It's a British company and they have a lot of British things, including candies. I've had several varieties of Cadbury chocolate things that were just extraordinary. As such, this evening I picked up a Cadbury Flake Bar. Mmmmmm, Gooood! That''s just delicious! It's not too sweet and has a nice rich cocoa/chocolate taste. My goodness! These are excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I was wandering by the cookies and crackers section in my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and spotted this small package (5.3 ounces) of Bahlsen Hit chocolate-filled cookies. They're imported from Germany and I've had other products made by Bahlsen that were quite good. These cookies are excellent. The biscuit part is nice and fresh. The chocolate creme center part is dark and tasty. They go real well with coffee, I might add. Probably tea too. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been trying to reorient my diet such that I eat much less animal products and much more fresh fruits, dried fruits,  fresh vegetables and nuts. My goal is to eat much less refined sugars. trans-fats, animal fats and cholesterol. Supposedly, this should help my health in a number of ways. So far the only noticeable things are a drop in weight and blood pressure. That's a start, a good start.<br /><br />One of the items I'm increasing is nuts and seeds. I find a good place to get these items in bulk quantity is Costco, particularly with their Kirkland Signature brand. Of course, a lot of people don't live anywhere near a Costco, but the branded items are still easily available online.<br /><br />Yesterday, I picked up a big bag (3 pounds or 48 ounces) of almonds. The almonds are fresh and tasty and unsalted. I actually, prefer salted nuts, but I'm also trying to cut the intake of salt so it's good to find these unsalted ones. The quality is excellent. About the only negative I can note is that the bag doesn't hold up well after being opened so I'll have to transfer the contents to a large zip-lock bag to attempt to maintain freshness. We use these nuts for meals and snacks, plus our three-year-old toddler enjoys them with his meals. It's a good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife admits to being a chocoholic and one of my tasks is to keep her away from it rather than be an enabler. Well, it's now the holiday season and there's all these gifts and good food and what not. So, we were in our local \"Fresh and Easy\" grocery store with all their nice little displays of gourmet foods and there was a small shelf of chocolate bars. She picked up a couple, and what could I say? One was a 3.5 ounce bar of Green & Black's Organic Milk Chocolate. We sampled (read: ate) it this evening after the meal. My wife was in almost in shock. She proclaimed that this was one of the best milk chocolates that she's ever had. It was simply outstanding!<br /><br />Well, I'm not a chocolate aficionado and, in fact, try to stay away from it because I can't control my consumption very well. I'd agree that this bar was outstanding! It was cocoa rich with a slight bitterness and tasted more like what I would call a dark chocolate. It was much less sweet than the typical milk chocolate and quite delicious. Evidently, a lot of care is taken in the manufacture and all the ingredients are organic. Well, the care shows. I can't remember a better chocolate bar.<br /><br />Try it if you ever get the chance. Be ready to get out the stored Thighmaster and exercise bike.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market imports a lot of European-style candies and one of them is Chimes (the original) Ginger Chews. If you enjoy the taste of ginger, you'll probably love these. Trust me. They're a chewy piece of candy that is strongly ginger flavored and not particularly sweet, at least not overly sweet. Each piece comes in it's own individual wrap. It says to store them in a cool dry place, and that would be a good suggestion because they can melt and stick to the wrappers. I just bought a single 1.5-ounce pack, but I'll certainly be back for more. These things are delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I picked up a few 16-ounce bottles of Hubert's Lemonade, one was classic and the other was mango. I thought it must be a new brand, but when I got it home I found out it was manufactured by Hansen's. Hubert Hansen to be specific. That's okay. Hansen's is a good quality brand of drinks. I just had the Classic for lunch. It was good. Not too sour. Not overly sweet either, and only about 70 calories for an 8-ounce glass. The taste was, well what can I say, like classic lemonade. It was quite refreshing and good tasting, but nothing I'd write home about. Would I buy it again? Sure.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This might seem a bit unusual, but I was in my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery and the goal was to pick up a variety of vegetarian items for use in a diet. They could be fresh, canned, pickled or dried. They all had to be low in calories and high in bulk. Of course, they would have low fat (if any) and, ideally, high fiber. To this mix, I added a variety of sources of protein. The idea was to get all ingredients the body might need, but an absolute bottom in calories. I eat all I want on this regimen and so far I've lost 9 pounds in 18 days.<br /><br />One of the items I picked up was a can of Dynasty Whole Baby Sweet Corn. I found it in the Asian foods section. I've had the baby corn mixed into a variety of Asian dishes, of course, but here I ate the mini-ears as finger foods to accompany my other items. They worked well. They were fresh and tasty and provided good bulk. They're rather bland tasting, but that didn't bother me at all. Will I come back for more? Sure, it's a good product and suits my needs well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have a three-year-old toddler and feeding him properly is always a problem. He seems to love junk foods and we tend to restrict them. Take the matter of beverages, for example. He loves all kinds of soda pop. We supply 100% juice drinks instead. He doesn't seem to mind and the juices disappear in short order.<br /><br />One that proved to be quite successful was the Apple and Eve Fruitables Juice boxes. They come in large packets of 6.75 ounces boxes and the large container holds a variety of flavors. Grandma brought over about a half dozen boxes and I believe she probably got them at Costco. In any case, they are a mixture of fruit and vegetable juices. I like the mix because the little dear doesn't seem to particularly like vegetables and this is a way of getting him some of the nutrients. I also like the no added sugar. He loves these things and will seemingly drain one in an instant. We try to keep about a half-dozen boxes stored in the fridge and ready to go. I tried them and they are quite good. I'm going to have to pick up another large container.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We've had this Kirkland Signature 16-ounce bottle of  Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla around the kitchen for several years now. We don't use it very much, but it's just one of those ingredients one has to have around a kitchen. My wife uses it in cookies, cakes, puddings and deserts of various kinds. Good vanilla is expensive and we got this KS Vanilla at our local warehouse store at what we regarded a bargain price. It's been excellent. We've been very satisfied. And it has a wonderful aroma!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I shop at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market for a lot of my evening meals. It's convenient and a lot of the meals are better than I can make. On the way to the check out, I pass by a large display of \"healthy\" candy items. Most of them might be called nutrition bars. I find them interesting and often select one for a dessert item with my meal. Last night's selection was The Good Bean fruit and chocolate bar using beans instead of the more conventional nuts. Roasted chick peas were a main ingredient. I just had to try it. Not bad. Dark chocolate taste. Chewy. Not very sweet. I felt as if I was consuming something healthy with a lot of fiber. No guilt feelings at all. Not bad, but not outstanding either.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Last time I was at my local Fresh and Easy store, I picked up a box (41g) of Koala's March cookies filled with chocolate creme. The cookie itself was very crisp and had a flavor somewhat like a fortune cookie. It was light and delicate and quite tasty. Inside was a delicious mix of soft  dark chocolate creme. Delicious. Very good combination. The box is listed at one serving and 220 calories. I noted a small amount of trans fat in the ingredients, if that bothers you any. These are quite delicious. A box goes fast!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a jar of Haywards Traditional Onions at a nearby Fresh and Easy store. They're a British company and have all sorts of interesting English imports. I guess that's what these are, although I can't decipher the address. Well, no matter. They're some really delicious pickled onions. I can't say that I've ever had any better. I can't figure out why. It might be the vinegar or the \"spice extracts\" as listed on the label. Well whatever. They're a bit expensive but, my, they're really good. And, of course, they've only got 11 calories per serving and no fat. Plus, the sodium is low which is good for a pickled product. Yum!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A few months ago I picked up a small container of MiO Liquid Water Enhancer. It was a new item and the only one the store had was the Berry Pomegranate Variety. Well, I must say, it enhanced San Diego tap water and gave it a very mild pleasant taste. This time, when I went back, the store had two kinds and I opted to try the Strawberry Watermelon flavor. Maybe I like it a little better. There are a lot of other flavors available online, I should add.<br /><br />This stuff seems to work best when the water is cold and first enhanced by ice. So, I was thinking that I might us it in restaurants. You can always ask for water with your meal and the water always comes with ice and is free. Typically, I ask for water because I don't particularly like most soft drinks and I don't like drinking too many of them. So I just ask for water and then add a little squeeze or the water enhancer to give the water a very slight, almost imperceptible, freshening zest. Well, let's see. There are 24 squirts in one of these little plastic thingies, and I save about $1.50 every time I ask for water, so they pay for themselves in almost instantly. Okay, so I'm a cheapskate and I enjoy it. Plus, and most importantly, I prefer the enhanced water taste over almost any soft drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's an interesting product. I don't know whether to call them crackers or cookies. I found them at my nearby Fresh and Easy Store. They have the square shape, thinness and crispness of a cracker. But they have an interesting chocolate-vanilla taste, and that's more like a cookie. On the box, they are referred to as cookies, and I'll go along with it, but I'm using them more like crackers and I plan to continue.<br /><br />They're quite good. They're mildly, although distinctly flavored, and are only slightly sweet. They have low fat and low salt content. The calorie count is modest. They're quite crispy and crunchy and go well with a whole variety of things, especially if you enjoy being a bit unconventional. As a cookie, I prefer them over most of the more conventional kinds. It's a kinda strange product, but they're quite delicious and I like them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I usually buy jerky in large bags that I find at Costco. Well, I ran out so I picked up a 3.25-ounce bag of Jack link's Original Beef Jerky (mesquite smoked) at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The jerky was excellent! Wonderful flavor! Thin sliced and dry. This is real good jerky! So, I went to report this on my Amazon reviews. You know, they had all kinds of Jack Link's Jerky (I'm amazed) but they didn't have a listing for 3.5-ounce bags of this particular kind. All right, I'll put my report here. It's the same product, just a different-sized bag. This is really good jerky. The more you can get, the better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A little while ago, I discovered SoBe Lifewater 0 drinks. I liked the antioxidants additives as well as the vitamins. The zero calories suits me well. The flavor was good. And the 20-ounce size of the bottle fit my needs well. I take them along on a daily walk and it's just about the right amount. My  first try was with the Black and Blue Berry variety and I liked it. Today was with the Yumberry Pomegranate variety and I like it better. Nice refreshing drink!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Several years ago my wife and I decided that there were too many soft drinks in our diet. We had quit drinking sugar-based drinks long ago, but we were still consuming artificially-sweetened drinks. Well, they're just a chemical concoction designed to resemble a traditional soft drink and they do a pretty good job of it. Excess calories are eliminated, but we worried about the listed ingredients and the quality of the water. Are they safe? Well, most people would think so, but we had lingering doubts. We started drinking a variety of bottled waters and my wife found several that were acceptable to her.<br /><br />About a year ago, I discovered some cases of Crystal Geyser Sparkling Mineral Water at our local warehouse store. I grew to like them quite well. The bottles (18 ounces each) came in four lightly flavored varieties and were carbonated. They suited my drinking tastes quite well. A chilled bottle is crisp and refreshing. Of the four flavors, my clear favorite was the Natural Lime Flavor. Delicious! I can't seem to do without it, and now I find soft drinks to be sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have gradually changed over to using olive oil in almost all of our cooking. We like the taste of it and the health arguments are convincing to us. We now haven't used any oil other than olive oil in the last three years.<br /><br />One convenient item that has helped our conversion is the availability of cans of olive oil spray. We give our pans a light coating for frying eggs and other things and we lightly spray salads with it. It's about the same as using regular Pam, except that the sprayed ingredient is Extra Virgin Olive Oil. We're very satisfied with this product and it's very convenient.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We've always liked applesauce and find the small containers to be convieniant. We use them for deserts on occasion, for snacks, camping and I put them into my lunch bag. Either TreeTop or Motts are the best brands, in our opinion. Lately, we've found another use. We use them with our one-year-old baby. He loves applesauce! It needs no fridge and has a long shelf life. A small tub is about the right size for a feeding. How convenient. Our boy likes the plain and cinnamon equally well. Our family consumption has gone up markedly and these mega-packs suite our needs well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We like to have some long-shelf-life foodstuffs so we can improvise meals at times when getting to the food market is difficult. We store cases of beans, veggies and some prepared meals in our pantry shelves. Some of the items are canned or dried fruit and one of them is a case of Festival Mandarin Oranges in light syrup. We purchased the case at our local Costco store and the case is now about three quarters finished. These mandarin oranges are delicious. They're very flavorful and I like the light syrup which makes them much less sweet than many canned fruits. I enjoy them as snacks now and then. An entire can is less than 200 calories. My wife and toddler like them too. We all like them best chilled so you'll generally find a can in the fridge. It's a very good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of my food shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and they continuously introduce new gourmet items, which I greatly enjoy trying. The latest was a couple varieties of Aloe Gloe Natural Aloe Water and mine is the White Grape Pulp-Free variety. It's quite a good drink. It's good tasting and refreshing. It's certified organic and contains all kinds of health benefits, as is explained on the label. Furthermore, it's gluten free and is only 35 calories per 15.2-ounce bottle. That's a hard-to-beat combination, and, yes, it's a bit pricey.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I have been on an anti-beverage kick when dining in restaurants. I don't want sweetened sodas or diet sodas and I've grown tired of iced teas. Well, almost any place will serve tap water if you ask for it, no  questions, and the majority will even provide ice with it. That's okay by me. But tap water can be bland and sometimes doesn't taste all that well. Then I discovered these little bottles of Mio Water Enhancer and they come in a variety of different flavors. One container holds 24 servings (little squirts) and the container can be easily carried in pocket or purse. Thus it is that when I go into a restaurant (fast food or sit-down), I always order water with ice. When the waiter is gone, I discretely give the water that tiny squirt. You can use any flavor you like, but I think the lemonade is the best for this situation. Some places will even serve a slice of lemon in your water. There's no color. The flavor and sweetness is almost imperceptible in ice water. It goes down much easier than tap water. And, if you're a frugal type, it easily pays for itself many times over rather than their soda drinks or iced teas.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. They're an English company that has only recently invaded southern California and Arizona. They're quite welcome, I might add. In any case, they carry a lot of foreign products, primarily British, and I enjoy trying them out. For example, they have a small selection of English candies. My wife used to live in London and she says that European candies are better than American candies. She says that they tend to be less sweet and more flavorful. I would agree. So, everytime I go to my local Fresh and Easy market I indulge in one (and only one) of their Candy bars. This trip I bought a Nestle Aero Mint Chocolate bar. Mmmmmm. Good. Excellent taste! And not so sweet that it hurts my teeth. Delicious! I'm going to have to go to this store less often. Things like this are just too hard to resist!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "When I have eggs for breakfast, I enjoy having ketchup or hot sauce, or both for that matter, with them. Often in restaurants, they'll have a little bottle of Tabasco along with the salt and pepper to satisfy people with tastes such as mine, so I guess it's rather common. Well, in my local grocery store I discovered a new and unexpected item, Tabasco Pepper Jelly. No kidding! Well, I just had to try it on my toast for breakfast. It's good, but rather strange to have something that is hot  and sweet at the same time. I enjoyed it. However, strangely enough, I don't think the jelly is hot enough. It's strange to say, but I think it would be a better product with a little more bite. Otherwise, it's very much like any other jelly except that it has little red flecks and pepper seeds within it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I keep reading about how we're supposed to have more fish in our diet. Well, okay, I can go along with that and I've been adding a few extra meals per week. Fish is hard for me to keep, so the kind I rely most on is canned fish and, to a lesser degree, frozen fish. As such, I was shopping at my local Costco store and came up with a pack of six cans (5 ounces each) of \"Wild Planet\" Wild Albacore Tuna. I just had some for lunch with wild and brown rice, baby carrots and celery. The cats went wild over the smell (a good sign).Very good tuna. Excellent taste! Well above most of the other brands of tuna that I've had. I'll be looking forward to trying it out in several casseroles that I make up. It's good to have stuff like this on the pantry shelves. It's so easy to make up something tasty and healthy too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I like strolling the aisles of my local warehouse store because you never know what you might find. For example, last week I found some delicious dried cherries by Kirkland Signature in the snacks isle. I've always thought the KS brand was of the highest quality, so I snapped up a bag in an instant. They're a somewhat tart Montmorency Cherry, and they're excellent. They're nice and chewy and have a wonderful taste. I use them as deserts, pack them with lunches and take them along on camping trips. Plus, they're easy to store so there's good quality fruit around even during times when a trip to the local grocery store isn't possible. Excellent product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I'm always in the search for snacks that might be tasty and nutritionally good for you at the same time. It's a difficult search. Here's one find: \"Majans Bhuja Cracker Mix.\" It's an assortment of small rice crackers, crisp noodles, green peas, peanuts, chickpeas and an assortment of flavors and minor ingredients. It's crunchy and good, like a good snack should be. The calories are not particularly high. It has a good protein and fiber content. It's low fat with no cholesterol and the sodium content is fairly low, even though it tastes salty. Nice mix. Oh, I might add that it's fairly filling so that I've had no tendency to eat the whole bag at one sitting, It's a product of Australia and I discovered it in a nearby Fresh and Easy store. It's good to find a few things like this.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I bought this can of Bar Harbor Manhattan Style Clam Chowder at a local grocery store. I found it in the gourmet food section rather than with the soups and decided to give it a try. It's a good soup. For a Manhattan Style Chowder, I'd like it to be a bit more tomato rich and a bit more zesty. However, the taste was quite good, the calories were reasonable and the salt was not overly high. I thought it made an excellent lunch along with a few trimmings. I'd definitely pick it up again and I'm surprised at the low ratings in some of the reviews.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Last week, I tried a box of Clif Kid Z Bar Chocolate Chip. six 1.27 bars came in the box, each individually wraaped. Well they were quite good. I enjoyed a few and I gave some to my boy (four years old). He enjoyed them too and they have a good mix of nutrients for a kid his age. So this week I was back in my Fresh and Easy Market and the Z bars were still on sale. This time I bought a 6-bar box of the Chocolate Brownie Bars.They're excellent. Nice rich dark chocolate flavor. Somewhat chewy and grainy. Not at all like a candy bar. Each bar is made out of 8 grams of whole grains plus 12 vitamins and minerals. They work out to 130 calories per bar and they've got a good fiber content. Not bad for a treat-type item.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Nearby I have a Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and I enjoy shopping there because they have some very unusual foods imported from all over the world, especially England. So, anyway, I was looking over the selections in the international isle and making a few guesses on what certain things might be like. One was Ziyad Premium Foule Mudammas Small Fava Beans in a 15.5-ounce can. Now what might these be, I wondered? I had no idea, but I've always liked beans and the picture on the front of the cans looked good. Into the shopping cart a can went.<br /><br />Fava beans. Hmmmm. I guess it's some type of mediterranean thing. So, I heated up a half can to go with some Buffalo Wings chicken I was having. Well, a quarter of the contents in the can was liquid, not beans. And I didn't care for the taste of the liquid. The beans were somewhat stiff and chewy, The closest thing I might compare them to would be chick peas, but they were darker, perhaps stained so by the liquid. Did they taste good? No, not particularly. Was I glad I had tried them? Well, at least now I know what they are. It was educational. Maybe I could somehow hide them as ingredients in a stew. Would I buy them again? Not likely.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I often pick up an evening meal at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market as I did this evening. Then as I go up to the check-out area, I pass by a beverage display and, quite often, I try one of their exotic drinks to have with my meal. This evening I chose Cascal Fermented Soda (tropical), a natural soft drink. The flavor is from mango, jasmine and kaffir lime and is slightly fermented. It's quite good. Nice fresh flavor. Only slightly sweet, which I prefer. It's low on sugar and the calories are quite modest (80 for a 12-ounce can. I'm glad I tried it. I'll be back.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Some time ago (September, 2009) I wrote a review for Mexican Coke. It came in 12-ounce bottles in a 24-bottle case. The bottles resembled the old fashioned Coke bottles. The main distinction between Mexican Coke and that manufacture in the USA was that Mexican coke was made with cane sugar whereas American Coke was made with high fructose corn syrup. Some people worry about possible health effects of HFCS and others simply don't like the taste as well. Personally, I think the Mexican Coike tastes a bit better. Gormet Coca Cola? Well, whatever, Mexican Coke has now become a big favorite and you can find it all over, even in restaurents.<br /><br />Now, on my last trip to my local Costco store, I found a 12-bottle case of \"Vintage Soda,\" a variety of past-famous American soda beverages. There's Dad's Root Beer, Bubble Up, Nesbitt's Orange Soda and NuGrape Soda. All are made with cane sugar. They're quite good, but I have no standard bottles for comparison. Also, I only rarely drink sodas. I have a supply at home, but it's mainly for guests. Some guests want diet drinks and some don't care for diet sodas. so for the sweetend ones, I use the cane sugar varieties.They get good reviews and it makes for an interesting conversation piece.<br /><br /> Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have trouble getting  enough fruits and veggies into our young boy (3.5 years old). It's an ongoing problem. Sometimes he'll eat all we serve and sometimes not. Sometimes he'll eat apples or grapes and sometimes he won't touch them. It's unpredictable. As such, we've tried a numbet of \"tricks\" to get him to eat more of the things we'd like in his diet. My wife brought home some Buddy Fruits blended puree in a squeezable bag. Down it went. It was the mango, passion fruit and banana blend. We were pleased with our discovery. That was a few weeks ago. Now he won't eat them in any flavor. Go figure. In any case, this product worked well while it worked and it may work again in the future. We'll keep trying. Who knows? Bananas were the same way.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I bought a few of these Nongshim noodle soups because they're easy to store and very handy for making a quick lunch on busy days. The latest I tried today was the Savory Bowl Noodle Soup, Chicken Flavor (3.03 ounces). It was quite good, much better than many other brands I've had in the past. The broth was particularly good. Very tasty. My reservations for food dishes such as this is the high sodium content. The soup doesn't taste particularly salty, but the nutrition label says a lot. I counter this by not having such dishes very often. However, if you're going to have these bowls now and then, this is quite a good one, the best I can remember.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's an item we always have around the house, although we often buy it in smaller containers. It's an excellent product and we can make up a batch of skim milk in very short order. My wife uses it for cooking and baking. She adds it to the baby's food. She uses it as a creamer for coffee and tea. We take it along for camping and it provides milk without the need for a fridge. We rely on it when we inadvertently run out of milk and can't immediately get to the grocery store. The taste is excellent, especially if you are used to skim milk and drink it very cold. This is very useful stuff to have around.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I shop for groceries at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and they have a good selection of gourmet items that I like to try from to time. One was La Panzanella Croccantini. The name sounds like something that would be an italian import, but they are made in Tukwila, WA. Well, in any case, they're a really good large cracker or hard-bread. I tried the rosemary variety first and just loved it. The items were so good, in fact, that the next time I went back I picked up a 5.5-ounce box of the Original Croccantini. Well, it's equally good. What can I say? These are the best crackers I can ever recall eating. They're lightly salted with sea-salt crystals. Does that do it? I have a slight preference for the Rosemary ones, but these are just excellent too. Use them with anything you might use a cracker with. The only difference is that these are much better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Shopping in one of those big warehouse club stores is an interesting experience. You wander around with this huge shopping cart looking at piles of stuff that you otherwise wouldn't be looking for and all of a sudden another impulse item goes into the cart. Take the other day, for example. We wandered down a food isle and there sat a palette of Kirkland Signature 100% Pure Maple Syrup. Well, we eat pancakes now and then, but we don't use maple syrup. It's just too expensive. We use  Aunt Jemima Butter Rich Syrup. But, there was this hugh display of Maple Syrup. Hmmmmmm. Well, maybe we deserve a treat now and then. After all, we've earned it by all the money we've saved on the other items. Another impulse item goes into the cart.<br /><br />Well, we've now been eating pancakes more frequently and I suspect that will last for a while. Mmmmmm, is that 100% maple syrup ever good! Boy, it sure beats Aunt Jemima. No contest. It was a little thinner and watery than I had anticipated, but what a delicious flavor! I felt like licking the plate when the pancakes were all gone. Why is it so much better? Well, I looked at the ingredients. The Kirkland Signature syrup had only one ingredient: pure maple syrup. The Aunt Jemima had 12 ingredients starting with corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup and ending with carmel color. One was all natural and the other was a manufactured concoction. Well, maybe the higher cost was worth it. After all, we don't use much syrup on a per breakfast basis and the 32-ounce bottle should last a long time. Mmmmm. I asked my wife when we're having pancakes again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've tried a number of Bar Harbor products and was favorably impresses with all. As such, I picked up a can of Bar Harbor New England Style Salmon Chowder. It was just excellent! Good taste and texture. Rich and creamy with nicely defined potato chunks. It says that the soup is condensed and they suggest that milk and butter may be added. However, at the time I didn't have any milk (other than chocolate) so I proceeded without additions. It just couldn't have been any better. Well, perhaps the sodium is a bit high. But it's all natural with no preservatives or MSG. I'll be back again!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "The last time I was in a nearby Fresh and Easy Market near where I live, I picked up a packet (1.41 ounces) of Sazon Goya Con Azafran, labeled as a unique seasoning. It was in the international food section near the Mexican foods. I've never seen it nor heard of it before and I had no idea what it was. The packet contained 8 smaller envelopes of a reddish powder flavor enhancer. The instructions were to add a packet to whatever you were cooking for four people. It said that the product would add more flavor and color to the food. Hmmm. That seemed strange. What flavor? To any food? The first-listed ingredient was monosodium glutamate, a well-known Asian food flavor enhancer, but the packet was not particularly high in sodium. Well, I just can't resist something like this. So, I was cooking up a few carrots along with some celery. I added a few bay leaves and some dill weed and one of the small packets of Sazon Goya. When they were done cooking I added a batch of prepared Split Pea Soup with ham. and heated up the entire batch. You know, that was the best split pea soup I can ever recall having. It had to be the Sazon Goya Con Azafran. Wonderful!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've never used much mustard, but I've always had a jar of the yellow stuff around for whatever purpose might come up. Then some time ago, I began noticing somewhat humorous TV ads for Grey Poupon. I ignored them, but then one day I picked up a two-jar pack (just like this, except 16 ounces) of Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard made with white wine at my local warehouse club. Wow! This stuff is really impressive and goes wonderfully with a wide variety of foods. Now my usage of mustard has gone way up. It's low in calories, inexpensive and flavorful in a delicious, zesty way. My jars have a little sticker that indicates it picked up a Gold Medal at the Napa Valley 12th Annual Mustard Festival. No surprise! Good-bye yellow stuff.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our local Fresh and Easy market is a british company and they have a lot of imported British items. I enjoy trying them. One of the latest is a bottle of Ribena Blackcurrent Concentrate. I thought it was just an expensive juice when I first bought it, but it was a concentrate to mix with water and that makes it much less expensive. I usually mix it with a slightly carbonated spring water that I keep ice cold in the fridge. Mmmmm. Good. Excellent, as a matter of fact and it's not very high in calories. I might add that my bottle is 600 ml and the bottle listed here is a liter, but otherwise it's the same exact product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife and I are always struggling to control our weight. We could stand to lose 10 (my wife) to 20 (me) pounds and we're always working at it. We try to eat a proper diet and we watch our fats and sugars and we try to get our exercise in, but life is so complex and we have so little time. Alas, following some strict regimen is difficult in itself and we need a reward, even a little reward, from time to time. My wife likes to have a small treat with her tea after a meal, for example. Well, most treats tend to be calorie dense or not much of a treat. She has come up with a variety of solutions and her latest is Kellogg Special K Fruit Crisps.<br /><br />Fruit Crisps come in a packet of two and the whole packet only amounts to 100 calories. We can open a packet after dinner, each have a little desert, and only ingest 50 extra calories. How harmful can that be? The Fruit Crisps are crunchy and tasty and come in several varieties. They have a slight coating of vanilla stripes. The total list of ingredients is long, and I tend to exclude such items, but again, it's only a little treat. Have a heart! Of course, you'd have to resist eating the whole box, but we've maintained control at only one packet per meal and we don't have them after every meal. So far, it's working rather well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I was at the neighborhood grocery store with my little boy (3) and we were going past the candy isle. Any of you with kids knows what that means. The question is not whether you'll get some candy, but what kind of candy are you going to get? Well, I don't like to feed the guy sugar, so I found these Ice Breakers Frost (wintercool) mints which are sugar free. He could hardly wait until we got out of the store to have one and I had one with him. Mmmmmm. These things are really good. Brisk and refreshing. Nice tasting. Long lasting. He loves them. Now he's carrying his little box around as a prize and I give him another every once in a while. I might have another myself too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "One rule I always try to follow is to never go to the grocery store when I'm hungry. Well, I missed on this one tonight. All was well as I visited my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market until I passed the baking chocolates. There sat a tray of Cadbury Crunchie bars. I couldn't help myself. The label said it was made in St. Bournville, Birmingham UK. It was 190 calories, but I'd been good all day. Into the cart a bar went, and I opened it first thing when I got home. Man, was this thing good! The outer chocolate cover was excellent but the best part was a crunchy caramel-like interior. I can't describe it. It tasted a bit like the inside of a Heath Bar, but it was better. It was part solid and part like a really stiff and crunchy foam. Did I mention that it was delicious? Mmmmm! One of the best bars I've had in years. To be honest, I don't consume many candy bars, but this one was certainly excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market sells a variety of prepared foods and a selection of somewhat exotic drinks that might go along with their meals. I enjoy trying them. last week I tried Honest Ade (Made by Honest Tea) Orange Mango drink and enjoyed it very much. Tonight I tried another flavor, Pomegranate Blue. It's certified USDA Organic. It comes in 16.9-ounce plastic bottles. It's low in calories, at about 100 per bottle, and they say it's sweetened \"just a tad.\" I'd say both the flavor is light and the drink is only lightly sweet. I prefer the lighter taste and the less sweet drinks so this suits my needs well. It has very low sodium. It went real well with my meal. Excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market carries a lot of gourmet items and I like to try them. This week two different varieties of Nonni's Biscotti Bites arrived on the shelves and I bought a 7-ounce bag of the Almond Dark Chocolate type. Oh, my! These are delicious! The biscuit part is fresh and ultra-crunchy and with an almond flavor. The flat bottom side has been dipped in a dark chocolate that melts in your mouth, as well as on your hands I might add. It's a very nice, very tasty combination and I have trouble limiting my consumption. They go wonderfully with coffee, and I suppose, they'd go equally well with cocoa or milk. The bag says that they're made according to an authentic Italian family recipe, but evidently they're not imported and come from Tulsa, Oklahoma. No matter. These are good!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up several gourmet varieties of soups at my nearby Fresh and Easy Market and one of them was Imagine Creamy Portobello Mushroom Soup (16 ounce carton). The carton is slightly different than the one shown here, but right on my carton it says \"New Package, same size,\" so I think it's exactly the same product. I made the soup up with some Garofalo whole wheat bow tie pasta. Mmmmm. It was good. Real nice and creamy and with an tasty mushroom flavor. I would have preferred some visible evidence of it being a mushroom soup, but the flavor was certainly excellent. This was quite good. Much better than canned things I've had in the past.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a special section of shelves having items they are trying to get rid of (for whatever reason) by offering them at discounted prices. Well, I love a good bargain so I always drift by the shelves. About a month ago they had a few cans of Manischewitz Condensed Chicken Broth (10.5 ounces) so I picked one up. That's something I can always use and it has a long shelf life. I used it today as an ingredient in soup. It was excellent. My feeling was it was superior to brands I've used in the past, but I have no way of testing that statement. In any case, my reaction was quite favorable. Maybe it seemed so good because I didn't notice it was condensed and I used it full strength.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our two cats are on a restricted diet because one of them came down with a urinary blockage problem. (The vet bill was about $700. Groan.) Now they dine almost exclusively on expensive prescription food, and they don't particularly care for it. Day after day. Also, their new diet has cut down their variety quite a bit. Well, the cats will probably do all right and, most certainly, they aren't starving.<br /><br />My wife feels sorry for the little dears and picks up special snacks or treats for them, which we give them in small quantities now and then. They seem to enjoy these special items as a break from their dull regimen. They like Bench & Field Holistic Natural Feline Treats as well as any, and these treats have a long list of supposedly helpful additives. I tend to be somewhat skeptical about such things and think they're much too expensive, but I seem to be a minority voice.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our nearby Fresh and Easy Market has an assortment of imported candies and they are fun to try. On my latest trip, I picked up a bag of Morinaga Hi-Chew Tropical Fruit Candies (Mango, Banana, Melon). They were quite good. First of all, they were quite chewy, but not enough to remove your fillings. Then the center of each was filled with the particular flavor you had chosen. I might add that each chew came individually wrapped and labeled.<br /><br />They are quite good candies. My reaction was they were not nearly as sweet as typical American Candies (these came from Taiwan, I might add). The inside flavors were light and  delicate, not overwhelming. Very nice taste and texture.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife is Russian and she grew up having tea as a main beverage. Later, she lived in London for several years. As such, she appreciates the finer varieties of teas and our kitchen pantry always has at least a half dozen different kinds of tea on the beverage shelf. Just the other day she picked up a 20-bag box of Ahmad Blackcurrent Tea at a little European delicatessen she favors. She's been raving about how excellent it is ever since and pressured me to try it. Well, it was good, but I'm really more of a coffee lover and it's as difficult for me to judge a fine tea as it is for her to recognize an outstanding coffee. Believe me, however, her taste in teas is refined and if she says it's excellent I would fully trust her judgment. The price, by the way, as listed here is a bargain.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a jar of Dickinson's Vanilla Curd (9.5 ounce) in the jams and jellies section of a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. F & E are an English company and they have a lot of British items in the store. Well, I'd never heard of Vanilla Curd but it seemed interesting and one of the instructions said it could be used as a spread in the manner of jams or jellies. Okay, into the cart it went and I had a spread of it on toast the next morning. Oh, my! It was delicious! Overwhelming! I can't believe how good this stuff is! It's smooth and creamy and has a real nice strong vanilla taste. I assumed it was something manufactured in England and imported, but in looking at the label I find it's from The Dickinson Family, Inc. (since 1897) of Oxnard, California, who manufacture English-style things. Well, I just can't imagine the real English item being any better. Outstanding!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've used Knorr Boullon Cubes before and was always satisfied with them. Good product. This time when I went to replace them  the store had only Knorr Caldo Con Sabor De Pollo bouillon powder so I purchased this 7.9 ounce jar. Works fine. In fact, I like it better in-as-much as I can adjust the amount much easier and stir the ingredient in much quicker than with the solid cube. I'm not certain why the label would be in Spanish as the product was bought in a store that was British owned. Oh well, such is life.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Shopping in warehouse stores lends itself to buying a lot of impulse items. Well here's one quite good such item. I was going down the snack isles of my local Costco and found a couple huge displays of roasted peanuts, one salted in the shell and one not. Hmmmmm.  A five-pound bag of peanuts? That's much more than I need! But I love salted-in-the-shell peanuts. But, how will I ever finish five pounds of them? Oh, well,  we'll figure it out. Into the cart they went.<br /><br />The peanuts are quite good. Excellent, in fact. The roast is just right. They are salted, but very lightly. I actually prefer a little saltier, but I know this lighter flavoring is better for my health. In fact, the sodium to potassium ratio is close to equal, a rare instance in a salted snack product. I'd say, the peanuts are just excellent, much better than the brands I'm used to buying in smaller packets. Plus, they're real nice and fresh. The trick might be keeping them fresh as I work my way down to the bottom of this huge bag. But, no mistaking, they're excellent peanuts.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long age we discovered these Horizon Organic Low-Fat Milk cartons. They're just the right size for a serving for our three-year-old toddler boy and he loves them. It didn't take him long to learn how to slurp one down and he just loved the chocolate flavored ones. Well, they come in other flavors too. As such, we picked up several of the strawberry-flavored ones because the store was out of chocolate. Would they work just as well? You guessed it! He slurped it down just as fast as the chocolate. I'm surprised, but he just loves this product!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife and I recently picked up a 30-ounce bag of Kirkland Signature Wholesome Fruit & Nuts at our local warehouse store. We use things like this as a relatively healthy snack, in contrast to the more common salty or sugar-laden snacks. I also add small baggies of the mixture with my lunch which I carry to work so as to avoid the food court offerings. This stuff is excellent! The nuts include almonds, walnuts and pistachios and they mix surprisingly well together. The dried fruits look a lot like raisons, but they are dried cranberries and cherries. The tastes are excellent in themselves and blend very well with the nut mixture. The total effect is one of the best fruit/nut mixtures I can ever remember having. The mixture had a very fresh taste, I might add. They're good enough that I tend to overindulge, so we have to be careful. Outstanding!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife picked up a canister of Gerber's Graduates Lil' Crunchies (Cheese flavored) and they were an instant hit with our one-year-old boy. Now we always have cans sitting around in the house and car. When he gets whiney, a Crunchy will almost always catch his attention. He loves them!<br /><br />In shopping around, we find that the Crunchies are available in a variety of flavors, but our boy always greatly preferred the cheese variety, so we continued to purchase them. Then, one day we found the Cinnamon Maple variety and decided to pick up a canister. Wow! They really hit the spot! He begged for more, even more than for the cheese ones. Mmmmm yum! OK, now we have another kind around in addition to the cheesy ones.<br /><br />Personally, I don't see what the big attraction is. They're nice and light-crunchy and practically melt in your mouth. They taste slightly like a very lightly flavored cinnamon roll with a slight emphasis on the cinnamon. If it were my choice, I'd favor the cheese variety.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "The Izze sodas/fruit juices are quite good. They're a bit more expensive but put the standard fruit sodas to shame. They are, after all, 70% fruit juice and shouldn't even be compared to conventional fruit-flavored sodas. I've now tried two, the first was Blackberry and the present is Pomegranate. Personally, I like the Blackberry a slight bit better but the Pomegranate is outstanding. It's tart. I like than. No sickly-sweet sodas for me! The taste is good and nowhere near the taste of pure pomegranate juice. That's okay. It's a nice refreshing drink with a little bite to it and no added sugar. This stuff is excellent. I think I have two more flavors to try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's a little item I picked up at my nearby Fresh and Easy Store. It's a British company and they have a lot of imported items. I was looking over their imports and found cans of Heinz Spaghetti in Tomato Sauce. Now, why would anyone import  such a mundane item as canned spaghetti all the way from England? Well my only response was that it must be very good. So I tried a can. I'm not used to eating canned spaghetti and I can't recall any since my poverty-stricken graduate school days. In any  case, I was  curious. It was excellent, the best canned spaghetti I can ever recall eating! No wonder they import it. You can't get stuff this good in the American brands, at least not that I'm aware of. Would it displace the regularly prepared spaghetti in my diet? No, but for canned spaghetti, this is really good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I was shopping at my nearby Costco Store and noticed a display of Cupcake Vineyards Red Velvet 2011 California Table Wine. I was curious. This was the first time I had seen the brand. Into the shopping cart a bottle went. I sometimes enjoy non-pretentious red table wines. They can often be quite good and a delightful surprise. This one was. It's good tasting and quite mellow for such a young wine. A real bargain. I'll definitely get more when I return.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "A couple days ago, I picked up a few cans (14.5 ounces) of Amy's Organic Soups and one of the varieties was the Chunky Tomato Bisque. I found it in the gourmet section of the store along with other Amy's products. I had a bowl of the soup late this morning for brunch with a helping of scrambled eggs. Mmmmm, boy, this is good soup! Gosh, I'm used to stuff like Campbell' s Cream Of Tomato and this is just worlds apart. Excellent flavor! Wonderful! Nice texture with the tomato chunks. It's one of the best canned soups I can remember, and it will go with a wide variety of other foods. This is a soup that I'll repeat again and again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, I try to keep away from things like this, but there they were: Newman-O's Creme Filled Mint Chocolate Cookies (13-ounce packet) made with organic flour and organic sugar. Hmmmm, how could I resist? Well, I couldn't. They're just one of my little occasional treats, or so I tell myself. Oh, these are delicious! Much better than the nutrition treats I usually eat The trouble is, I just can't stop at a reasonable number. They're just too good. And the \"Hint of Mint\" is just perfect!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up these Crunchmaster Rice (Artisan Four Cheese) Crackers at a nearby Costco Store. They looked good, and a lady gave me one to taste. They were good. Into the cart went a six package box. They're the same as these, only packed together in a slightly different way.<br /><br />The crackers are excellent. They're real crunchy, way moreso than most crackers and they have the faint taste and smell of cheese. They're lightly salted and have a very low fat content. I enjoy them by themselves as snacks, or I eat them with smoked oysters or sardines as a light lunch. Or, I have them with a variety of spreads. They're pretty versatile, and delicious I should add.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "It was too hot today (mid-August), much too hot. I had just skipped lunch and I was getting hungry. But I didn't feel like eating much and certainly not cooking. In scratching around my pantry, I found a 3.75-ounce tin of Crown Prince Baby Clams Smoked in Oil. Ah, maybe that would do. Let's add a few salted crackers. Nice tasty snack lunch. Good protein too. Just right on this miserable day.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I only drink whole-bean, grind-it-youself coffees. Sorry, I just couldn't go back to those other hot dark liquids that other people call coffee. No, once you get used to grinding your own you're hooked. The question might be, where do you get good whole bean coffees at a reasonable price? Grocery store prices for one-pound bags tend to be high. Likewise, specialty shops can be very high. I've found two good sources: Trader Joe's and Costco, plus a wide variety can be found online. For the past few years I have switched almost entirely over to my local Costco. A problem with Costco is that they may have only two different kinds, but the kinds may change every other time you go there.You just don't have much choice unless you work at it a bit. However, every bag I've bought has been excellent. Well, it better be because you can only buy it in three pound bags.<br /><br />My latest acquisition is a three-pound bag of Jose's 100% Columbia Supremo. Mmmmmm. Nice aroma! It's a medium roast, soft and mellow. No harsh aftertaste. It reminds me of Trader Joe's Columbia Supremo, and I understand that is just the government's grade for Columbia's finest. In any case, it's a nice coffee and I'll have no trouble getting through it. I might add, that I like to switch types from bag to bag and I've now tried coffees from all major growing areas of the world.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been picking up some of the gourmet items newly stocked by my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and one of these is a 5.3-ounce packet of Bahlsen Hit Cookies with a cocoa creme central filling. The outer cookie is light and fresh and tastes somewhat like a good fortune cookie. The center is a chocolate/cocoa creme layer of filling. I'd say it leans somewhat toward the bitter part of the chocolate spectrum and that's the way I like it. The cookies are manufactured in Poland by a German company.  They're quite a nice treat. I'm going to see if they have any other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Store has a variety of imported treats and I can't seem to stay away. This latest trip I bought a packet (10 pieces) of Glico Pocky Almond Crush Biscuit Sticks imported from Japan. If you haven't run into these. they're somewhat like an elongate unsalted pretzel (about 6 inches) and then this stick has been dipped into a delicious milk chocolate and rolled in crushed almonds. Only about the last inch of the stick is not covered. It's sorta like a strange elongate cookie. LOL  But they're delicious and don't last long. One box of these (10 sticks) comes to a 180 calorie serving with 100 of the calories coming from fat. Well, there's no need to eat the whole box, if you can resist. As a desert, it might be appropriate to open a box and then pass around two or three sticks to each person. In any case, they're quite a nice and unusual treat.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not terribly long ago, I found some really delicious Sunsweet Dried and Pitted Plums on a small bag (about 6 ounces). They were excellent, some of the best dried plums I've ever had. Of course, I wrote them up for Amazon an Amazon review and gave them a 5-star rating. You can probably find my report, if you like.<br /><br />Well, today I visited my local Costco warehouse store and found those same dried plums relabeled under the Kirkland Signature/Sunsweet brand and in a much larger 56-ounce bag. I was delighted and picked up a bag, although this is a lot of dried plums. Anyway, they're an excellent product and much cheaper by the ounce in such a economy large bag. They're good tasting and have a lot of vitamins and fiber and they're not overly high on calories. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />As you may know, plums (or prunes) can be an excellent natural laxative for bowel regulation and I use them on that basis frequently. You might take care with these. They're so delicious that you can easily overindulge and may pay the consequences. Not too long ago, I greatly overate and about a couple hours later I was able to excrete through the eye of a needle. Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, for a little touch of humor, but take care.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I just picked up a small supply of Horizon Organic Low-Fat Milk of the vanilla flavor. I like to have it in my pantry because it has a long shelf life and is quite good. I use it mainly for my little boy (3.5 years old). I get regular milk and chocolate milk at the store, but I like to have this around as a change of pace and as an emergency backup supply when we run out. I must admit that I have a box now and then and it's a good, nutritious drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I was recently looking for lunch items at my local warehouse store and found this four-pound bag of Kirkland Signature Trail Mix. That would do fine. I put a handfull in a sandwich bag and pack it with my noon work time lunch. Stuff like this, together with a sandwich and piece of fruit is much preferable to dining in our food court, plus eating in my office saves a lot of time. The mix consist of peanuts. Raisins, almonds, cashews and a few M&M candies thrown it. There's no cholesterol or trans fat, but the calorie content is fairly high. It's nice and fresh and tasty and will stay that way in a bag that can be resealed. Also, when space is available, we store it in the fridge. It's a lot of trail mix, but I use it every other day and it's used around the house as a snack and we also take it camping.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been trying to increase the seafoods part of my diet and I've been trying a lot of canned items because of their ready availability and ease of storage. One of my recent items is Crown Prince Crab Meat (fancy white) in a 6-0z. can. I'm disappointed with this product. First, rather strangely, it's the only canned item I've ever had where the contents came wrapped inside the can. Second, the finely shredded crab meat therein was way overly waterly. Third, the crab meat had very little taste. I guess I could have guessed the latter when I opened the can and could detect virtually no odor. I got by with it using it as a spread on some simply delicious crispbread crackers and with a little seafood sauce to add to the flavor. Unfortunately, then all the flavor was coming from the sauce and the crispbreads, and very little from the crab meat. Did I miss something here? Was this just a bad can sample or are all cans of this product this way. My inclination would be not to buy another can.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's a nifty item. I picked up one of these 16 packs of Materne GoGo Squeez Applesauce at my local Costco Store just out of curiosity. I can give them to my little boy (3 1/2) and he loves them. In addition, I like to slip one in my pocket when I take my daily walk. It makes for a refreshing break, whether I stop walking or just consume it on the go. My present particular variety is appleberry, but I'd like to eventually try them all.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife brought  a couple variety packs of Fruit Gushers for the last Halloween give-away. Unfortunately, we had a few packs left over so we've been consuming them from time to time. My wife likes to give them to our toddler as a little reward. He loves them, of course. Actually, they are rather good. They're a candy that looks like a small irregular blob. It's soft to the touch and tastes fruity. The trick is that when you bite down the soft blob crushes and releases a sweet and fruity flavored syrup into the mouth. They're quite flavorful and enjoyable to eat. My main worry would be that the candy itself is quite sticky and hard to get off the teeth, so brush carefully after indulging.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I discovered the Sokenbicha line of Japanese teas at my local Fresh and Easy store. They're excellent, but rather expensive. The latest one I've tried is a bold Barley Tea Blend. Man, this stuff is really good and unlike any other tea I've ever had. I'm at a loss to describe the flavor. It's fairly strong for a tea and has a wonderful aftertaste. It must be the barley. The green tea or pu'er tea might help too. In any case, it's a really refreshing tea served ice cold. It's unsweetened and has zero calories. My oh my!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Well, it might seem hard to believe, but I've never had anchovies. It just hasn't happened. Mainly I hear of them when a group orders pizza and somebody in the group always insists on no anchovies. Hmmm, why? In any case, I was in the grocery store and I was picking up some sardines and right next to them were Crown Prince Anchovies (2-ounce flats) packed in olive oil. I took the plunge. Into the cart they went. This evening I had the can with some very excellent crispbreads. Well, these Crown Prince anchovies were excellent! They're very strongly flavored and have a very salty taste, but I like them. No question. I'll be back for more. And next time when a group orders pizza and somebody says no anchovies, I'm going to speak up in their favor.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago, my wife picked up a bar of Green & Black's Milk Chocolate. To make a long story short, It was the best milk chocolate either of us had ever tasted. I've always preferred dark chocolate to milk chocolate, but the Green & Black's milk chocolate came very close to being a dark chocolate, in my opinion.<br /><br />Well, the next time we returned to the store to pick up another bar we noticed they also had Green & Black's Organic Dark Chocolate (70 % cocoa, almost twice that of the milk chocolate bar). My mouth watered at the thought.<br /><br />Mmmmmm. Yum! This stuff is incredible! It's not sweet, at all. But it's not really bitter either. It's just so (how can I say it?)  chocolatey! Sorry, but I'm at a loss for words. Let's just say, it's the best dark chocolate I've ever tasted. It's rather hard and the bar snaps when you bite into it, but when you chew it just floods your mouth with a deep, dark chocolate flavor. You have to be something of a dark-chocolate fan to enjoy this. My wife says it's good, for example, but she still prefers the milk chocolate. If you're a dark chocolate lover, give this a try! Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I don't drink hard booze. I just can't handle it. Wine is about the strongest I can tolerate. However, my wife has used Myers's Rum (Original Dark) for cooking and has had good results with it. Well, this may seem a bit out of place but.... I came up with a lung infection (bad cold) in late June and just haven't been able to shake the aftereffects. My lungs feel somewhat clogged and I run out of energy easily. I was talking to a nurse friend about the problem and he advised to take some brandy in a brandy glass and to very lightly sip and inhale at the same time. The idea was mainly to breathe the fumes in, not to consume the liquor. He said the fumes would relieve the congestion. Okay, it seemed worth a try, but I didn't have any brandy. So I asked if my wife's Myers's Rum might work, being as it was rather strongly aromatic. He said to give it a try. Well, I'm reporting here that it worked marvelously well. The fumes are strong and make my lungs feel refreshed. The next day, I was able to breath better. I've done it several additional times since. So, that's your little helpful hint for the day. Also, enjoy the rum. It certainly smells good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a bag (4.23 ounces) of Asturi Bruschettini Classico Toasts at my nearby Fresh and Easy Market. They have a nice selection of imported gourmet items and I thought I might try these snack-sized bruschetta toasts. Oh, these are good! It's a nice light toast with a slight flavor of olive oil and they're really fresh and crunchy. Mmmmm. I'm having them with some creamy Portobello mushroom soup, but they'll go with a wide variety of things. Good, good, good!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I tried a couple bottles of Aloe juice not to long ago and I liked it very much. At the time I noted that there was also Aloe Pulp Juice available so this time I tried a couple more bottles without even thinking about it. That was a mistake. I opened a bottle of ice  cold juice and too a swig. It was much too sweet! Some people might like it, I would hasten to add, but not me. I prefer drinks to be light, refreshing and almost sweet free. This stuff is like drinking concentrated sugar water. Well, I looked at the ingredients and it contains sugar cane syrup and honey. No wonder! If sugars and calories (this bottle contains 220) are not a problem, then you might enjoy this drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Somewhere along the line I switched from ground coffee in a can to whole bean coffee that you grind yourself. There was no turning back. From that time on the only question was what kind of whole bean coffee. I've tried dozens. Finally, I settled in on Trader Joe's Columbian Supremo. It was excellent! However, I found myself running out with no trip to Trader Joe's in the near future. So, I picked up a bag of Starbucks French Roast while visiting my local discount store. Starbucks was excellent, wasn't it? I've always thought so in their shops.<br /><br />This Starbucks French Roast Coffee is quite good. I might prefer a slightly less robust roast, but that's just a personal preference. What I notice about it more than anything else is that when I have guests over and serve coffee, I always get compliments and they want to know what kind of coffee I'm serving. I guess the wonderful aroma and the robust good taste just overcomes them. Well, that's worth something, isn't it? Personally, I might go back to another purchase of the Trader Joe's Columbian, but this is quite an excellent coffee, without question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I seldom chew gum. Almost never. However, I've been on a few long  driving trips with my wife and I felt myself getting drowsy. I noted such to my wife so as to warn her. She asked if I'd like a stick of gum. She said it helped you to keep alert. Hmmmm. I'd never heard of that. Well, I tried it and chewing gum worked remarkably well for that task. It makes good sense. Have you ever tried to chew gum and fall asleep at the same time? It just won't work.<br /><br />Well, the other day I was in our nearby grocery store and I spotted some Trident Vitality gum of a variety called Awaken. That sounded like just the thing to have in the glove compartment of the car. It's a real fresh, zesty, peppermint-flavored gum with added ginseng. Tastes real good. Plus, it's sugar free. It comes in little \"pillows\" rather than sticks and I'd probably have to chew a couple to get a good effect. It's somewhat expensive for chewing gum, but if it helps to keep me awake on the road, it's well worth it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "One of the items I picked up on my latest visit to my local Costco Warehouse store was a huge 2.5 pound can of Kirkland Signature Super Extra-Large Virginia Peanuts. I've never seen such a large can. These ought to last a while! Plus the can has a replaceable top to help preserve freshness.<br /><br />The peanuts are lightly roasted and lightly salted. They are completely devoid of their skins. Good crunchyness. Good flavor, if slightly somewhat bland. It's a good buy for me in that I've cut down on meats and other animal products as a matter of health and peanuts have no animal fats nor cholesterol, yet offer a good protein component to the diet.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I use a lot of bay leaves, particularly in soups and stews. Not too long ago I ran out. We'll you'd think that bay leaves would be a standard item found in almost any grocery store, but that's just not the case. I finally found this 2-ounce jar of McCormick (Gourmet Collection) Turkish Bay Leaves in the spice section of a nearby Costco Store. Well, It's really much more than I anticipated, but I use them all the time, so what the hey? When I got home I took the cap off and took a good sniff. Oh, my. What nice smelling bay leaves. Fresh and zesty! These were obviously much better than the one they replaced. I've only tried them in one soup so far but it turned out excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I first discovered Pocky Biscuit Sticks a few months ago, They're somewhat like a long pretzel (without salt) where one end has been dipped in a fudge-like candy. They're an interesting treat and, because they individually come in small portions, I like to use them as treats for my young (4 years) boy. The first ones I discovered were chocolate. This last time I decided to try the strawberry. I'd have to say that I prefer the chocolate. My boy shows no preference for one or the other.<br /><br />Gary Petesron\n",
      "I've been trying out a few blended red California wines which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Store and a few of them have been exceptional bargains. They're totally unpretentious wines, of course, but some have been exceptionally good values, in my opinion. So, I was back for trying another. There it was up on the top shelf and boldly proclaimed as \"The Big Red Monster,\" California Red Wine 2010. The bottle presented  a lot of hype about how good it tasted and how bold it was, but it didn't show any information about the grape varieties used in the brewing of the wine. Well, I should have known better than to buy. It just doesn't live up to the hype. It's not a bad wine at all. I'd say it compares favorably with many California reds that cost about five to six dollars a bottle. It tastes a little young, and is not really distinct in any way. Other much better reds are available for the same price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have two cats, one 4 years old and the other 5. Both are neutered males and we've had them since kittenhood. Of course, there's the litter box. Right from the start we picked up a big (40 pound) plastic container of Scoop Away at our local Costco Warehouse store and we've been using the brand ever since. Recently, Costco stopped carrying it and switched to Scoop Away Complete Performance cat litter, which supposedly has a variety of improvements and which comes in a large very tough plastic bag and weighs 42 pounds. Whew, that's a lot of litter but the bag is real sturdy and has a ziplock closure This new litter has been just excellent. It clumps into nice hard nodules and it's easy to clean the litter box. It has excellent odor control unless I forget to clean the box regularly, which I do at times. About the only complaint I might have is that the litter is somewhat dusty. This proves no problem with us in that the litter box is within 10 feet of the back door and we add litter by taking the box outside. Excellent Product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Oh, boy! I could tell these were going to be good when I cracked open the bag. What a nice aroma! I was right. They're excellent! Well, I usually buy pistachios in the shell, but I passed by these bags in the nut section of my local Costco store, and I just couldn't resist trying them. They're great. Nice and fresh. Salted to perfection with the potassium content still almost double the sodium content. Lots of fiber and unsaturated fat. What more could you ask? Did I mention that they're delicious? Wonderful, indeed!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy whole-bean coffees from all over the world. Costco is my major source for beans and they usually come in three-pound bags. Kirkland Signature is the most common brand, but a few other brands appear from time to time. A problem with Costco is that at any particular time they may have only two or three varieties. But if you come back a month or so later, they still may have only two or three but they will probably be a different two or three. It's something of an adventure and a good way to exp[ore the coffees of the world. Plus, if you find some variety that you really, really like, you may find it available on line, as is this one.<br /><br />Well, here's an excellent coffee. It's a Guatemalan Whole Bean Coffee. Nice aroma, but relatively mild compared to other bagged coffees. Excellent taste, but it's a quite lighter roast than I'm used to. That's OK. I like variety. This one has an excellent coffee taste and is smooth and delicious. It goes down easily, that's for sure. Smooth and mellow. Nice lingering aftertaste. I would think that any coffee lover would find it excellent, but some may expect a deeper, darker roast in a whole bean coffee. For me, this is a really nice coffee.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I'm not much of a candy eater, but I enjoy a bit of chocolate now and then. When I eat chocolate, I've always preferred the somewhat dark and bitter types usually referred to as bittersweet chocolate, but they can be a bit hard to find. My wife is just the opposite. She prefers the much lighter milk chocolate and will use the bittersweet only for baking purposes. Well, one day she offered me a couple pieces of her baking chocolate, and man, was it good!<br /><br />Well. I was doing some shopping in my neighborhood Fresh and Easy Store and bittersweet baking chocolate was on the list. That's how I found the Ghirardelli Premium Chocolate Baking Bar. It wasn't in the candy section. It was in the baking goods section. It was labeled as bittersweet chocolate with a 60% Cacao content and it came in 4-ounce bars. Well, you just know I had to try some when I got home. Mmmm! Man, was it good! I'll take this stuff over the chocolates in the candy section any day. Evidently, most people don't feel that way. Their loss!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Eat more fish. Eat more fish. I seem to read the advice everywhere. Well, that's not a bad idea for health reasons, and I like fish now and then. It just doesn't seem to work it's way into our diets often enough. Well, I discovered a way that may get around that problem. While shopping at my local Costco warehouse store, I discovered  a wrapped set of six six-ounce cans of Bear & Wolf Pink Salmon. It's wild Alaskan salmon, packed with a little water and salt, and it's skinless and boneless.<br /><br />I opened up a can when I got home. It has very little \"fishy\" odor, although my  cats certainly got excited when the top came off the can, and the taste is fresh and mild. Excellent! One of the reviews suggested eating it raw, so that's what I did with a variety of salad veggies. Mmmmm, good. Nice lunch. I'll surely repeat this. Plus the unused portion in the can was easy to cap and return to the fridge. Another suggestion was to put it in casseroles for baking. Of course, I can hardly wait. A scalloped potato dish with salmon ought to be excellent. Or salmon with noodles. I can even take it along as a quality source of protein when I go camping. That's what I like about this product. It's high quality, real handy and easy to store.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Last week I bought a couple Indian-style items in  heatable pouches. My idea was they might be used for a quick lunch. Today, I tried the second of then, Tasty Bite Aloo Palak. It's real easy to prepare. You just partially tear off the top part of the pouch and put the pouch into the microwave for 90 seconds. Afterwards, you empty it into a bowl or wherever else you may be putting it. It dish is all vegetarian with potatoes being the most obvious ingredient. Spinach, tomatoes and onions and a variety of spices are included. The potatoes stand out with the other ingredients cooked into a gray-green rather unappetizing mush. The spicing is very mild for Indian food. The taste is all right, but nothing I'd write home about. The fat and sodium content are low, to it's credit. All in all, I'm disappointed with this dish and probably wouldn't be buying it again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy visiting a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market because they stock so many exotic gourmet items. It's a British company and a lot of their items are imported from the British Isles. For example, on this latest visit, I picked up a jar (12 ounces) of sliced beetroot that was nicely pickled. Mmmmm. They are just exceptionally good. We always called them pickled beets, and I haven't seen any for years and years. Well, these are a nice reminder. Not only are the beets themselves quite good, but the pickling juices are good for a refreshing drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been trying out a few treat items on my cats. We feed them twice a day but they always seem overly hungry, even though they are both at their proper weight. Go figure. In any case I bought a few items to treat them in between meals and one of them was Friskies Party Mix - Mixed Grill Crunch. Boy! These  things disappear in an instant! It's amazing! Evidently, it's an exceptionally good treat!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been on a campaign to add more fish to my diet and a lot of it has been by increasing my uptake of canned fish such as tuna, salmon and sardines. As such, I found a wrapped five-pack of Season Sardines at my local Costco store and picked it up. They're a good sardine and I've been eating them with seasoned crackers at lunchtime. Their somewhat larger than normal for me and they have a texture that is somewhat firm. The taste is excellent and they go down easily. My cat loves to lick the leftover crumbs on the plate. I don't care for Season Sardines as much as for the last can of Crown Prince bristling sardines, but the difference is slight. I would definitely buy this brand again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've had \"Blue Diamond' almonds on many occasions, of course. It's a rather famous brand. But all my sampling was fron small bags or smallish cans. This time I was in a Costco Warehouse Store and they had a big display of 38-ounce plastic jars of Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds. How could I refuse? These things are really delicious. My goodness! And I love that Smokehouse Flavor. I have to limit myself to a certain portion or I'll consume a half jar at a sitting. About the only thing I don't care for is that they seem a bit salty. I love the flavor, but I worry about taking in that much salt. In any case, watching the portions will also be a way of watching the salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy jerky and like to try new kinds and new brands. Last week at the nearby Costco, I found 16-ounce packets of Pacific Gold Teriyaki Turkey Jerky, subdivided into two 8-ounce pouches. It's good! It's tender, but chewy. It has a nice flavor, but it's a little too sweet to be ideal for me. It has a very low fat and cholesterol, but is perhaps a little high on salt. The jerky seemed good and fresh, if you can apply that word to jerky. This stuff is pretty good. I don't think it's going to last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a bottle of Kedem Grape Juice (concord) at my local Fresh and Easy Market. I thought it was one of their concentrates, but when I got it home I found out it was just grape juice. That's okay, it was quite excellent concord grape juice, one of the best I've tried. Fine flavor. Delicious. It''s quite sweet, but it has no added sugar or any artificial sweeteners. My problem with it, which may not apply to other people, is that it's too high in calories (150 per 7-oz. serving). I can partly get around this by diluting it with a slightly carbonated water, but this dilutes the delicious flavor also. In any case, it's an excellent product and I highly endorse it if you can stand the high caloric content.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a bunch of new gourmet items on the shelves, one of which is Bahlsen Waffeletten Wafer Rolls. Basically, they're a fine light and delicate wafer (about 1 1/2 inches wide) that has been rolled tightly and then one end of the roll has been dipped in a tasty milk chocolate. Mmmmm. It's a nice combination. These wafer roll would make a fine item to go with tea or coffee, or you can just eat them as they are for a bit of dessert. Quite excellent. They're imported from Germany.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a bag of Loacker Quadratini Chocolate wafer cookies at a nearby Fresh and Easy Store. It's only a 4.42 ounce bag, but otherwise is the same product. I wish I had an 8.82 ounce bag. These things are delicious. They're labeled chocolate, but they taste more like cocoa. I guess the taste is pretty close. In any case, they're not very sweet and I like that. They're also nice and fresh. It's a good product. I'll try some of the others when these are done.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a box (16 ounces) of Imagine Organic Creamy Tomato Soup at my nearby grocer. I'm certain it is exactly the same soup as this, but it comes in a slightly different package. Right on the outside, it says \"New Package same size.\" In any case, I had a bowl with my evening meal. It was quite good. I wouldn't rate it with the best tomato soup I've ever had, but it was much better than ordinary canned varieties. It has a good fresh tomato flavor and a nice creamy texture that allows it to go down easy. The soup seems a little high in sodium, not apparent by taste, which seems to be the case with many prepared soups. The fat and calories are low. It's a nice soup and went well with the other foods I had.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife bought a variety of munchies for our son who is going through teething. These items are not a main part of his diet, but rather occasional snacks that he might chew on. One item was Gerber Graduates Fruit and Cereal bars. She first bought the strawberry and banana variety. These bars somewhat resemble a fig bar or other fruit bar where the fruit is on the inside and a coating of cereal on the outside. I found them to be dry and bland tasting. Our boy ate the bars, but somewhat reluctantly. I suspect we got a box that was somewhat stale from residing on the shelf too long.<br /><br />Our next box was of the Apple and Cinnamon variety. He seemed to like these somewhat better, but they still are not one of his favorite chewy items. In any case, he seemed to enjoy biting and chewing on them but acts as if he could really use a drink to go along with them. That does not surprise me as they are rather dry and granular, as if sawdust might be a hidden ingredient. However, we give him a bar from time to time and get a kick out of him eating it bite by bite. It's worth a try at this stage of his development.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I recently purchased a 12-ounce bottle of AXE Temptation Shampoo and Conditioner I've liked other AXE products, so I tried this one. Well, there was a big surprise. I poured some out into my hand and it was brown. It looked like Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. Really. You put this stuff on your hair? Well, of course, and I did. It had a real good lathering ability and a nice fragrance. Furthermore, I think it did a nice job on my hair. To be honest, my hair isn't the best test. It's only about an inch long and wouldn't even need a conditioner. Ah well, it worked fine and I really like the fragrance. Just be ready for the appearance.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I like beef, pork and turkey jerky and I usually buy it in large bags at Cosco. Lately, I've been forgetful and last time they didn't have the kind I wanted, so I've picked up a few small bags (3.25 ounces) of Jack Link's Jerky at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The first one was Turkey Jerky and it was excellent. Today, I picked up a bag of Teriyaki Beef Jerky. This stuff is just excellent! It's very lean and thin cut, nice and dry, wonderful tasting and has a very low fat content. The nutritional specs are sensational for a snack item and the calories are not particularly high. This is just about the best jerky I can recall. I may have to switch brands.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My wife likes to bake cookies now and then, especially for parties and such. She's tried all kinds of ways to get cookies that don't stick to the baking tray. Nothing works completely. Then one day she read in the Martha Stewart Living Magazine, that parchment paper was the thing to use. Parchment paper? I'd never heard of such a thing. Neither had she. Well, I was dispatched to the local supermarket with the instructions to get some. First of all, I had no idea where to look or what to look for. I asked a couple clerks and it baffled them too. Finally. one knew. It was over with the waxed paper and occupied a tiny space on a top shelf. \"If You Care\" was the brand. \"If You Care\"? I might expect Betty Crocker or something like that. Anyhow, I brought a 70-foot roll home. My wife reported that it worked perfectly. Not a single cookie stuck. She'd never bake cookies again without parchment paper. That was almost four years ago.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We have a Fresh and Easy Grocery Store not too far from us. It's a British company and has all sorts of imported English items, some at rather reasonable prices. I've been trying a few now and then and some of them are rather impressive. On such item is Heinz Treacle Sponge Pudding. I heat it up in the microwave and serve it with a slight coating of Devon Custard. It's quite good. Very pleasantly sweet and tasty. A nice dessert. My only complaint would be that it has a very high sugar content resulting in a very high calorie count. The pudding is quite delicious, but I'll have to restrain myself as to how often it is served. Such is life.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I just recently discovered some small boxed drinks (4.23 ounces) at a nearby market that are called Hansen's Tropical Junior Water Beverage. They come in several varieties, but I chose the tropical variety for whatever reason I'm not certain. I got them for my little boy (about four years). Junior Water for Junior, so to speak. He's always asking for a drink and I suspect he'd prefer soda pop or some other unhealthy thing. I try to head off this desire by providing him with some more nutritious alternatives and this beverage is one of them. It's organic, low on sugar (real sugar, by the way) and has a mild but excellent taste. He likes them. I much prefer giving him these rather than some of the alternatives.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I just can't resist stuff like this. Not only is it delicious, but it offers certain health benefits. It's Brookside Dark Chocolate with Acai Blueberry centers. Mmmmm. Are these good? Careful, you'll overdose. The chocolate is excellent. The center is made out of concentrated juices of blueberries and other fruits. Nice combination! I picked up my 2 pound bag at Costco, but I see they're available online too. I also picked up a bag os Brookside Dark Chocolate with Pomegranate centers, but I like the Blueberry best by a slight margin. Nice Candy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "We bought a four-pack of 10-ounce Milton's Multi-Grain Crackers for a Christmas party. Everyone who tried them liked them. However, we ended up with three of the four packs left over. Tough break! I love these things! I use them as a late night snack while watching TV. I add them to my noon lunch at work. I use them for improvised lunches when I don't feel like cooking anything. They're delicious. Very tasty. And I love the crunchy, somewhat gritty texture which goes along with the excellent flavor. Plus, they're mostly whole grain. What more could you ask?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "This is a real nice beer. Excuse me, Ale. And what an ale it is! Real rich, hoppy flavor and full bodied. Nice aroma. Don't confuse this with the pale imitations that are sold on most supermarket shelves. Sierra Nevada Topedo Extra IPA is bold! Just look at the alcohol content. It's 7.2 % and that's really up there. Please be careful about drinking this stuff and driving. When you say \"But Ocifer, I've only had two Sierra Nevada Topedos.\" you may be legally drunk. Torpedoed, so to speak. But sitting at home with the TV on, it's a real nice brew!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I discovered the \"Sparkling Ice\" Lemon-Lime drink and enjoyed it very much. Next, I tried the Black Raspberry flavor. I like it even better. Mmmm, good. It's ever-so-slightly carbonated with a nice fresh flavor. Goes down easily. One surprise is that it somewhat sweet. Sweet. Hmmmm. I looked over the ingredients at the suggestion of a reader and there's no sugar but it evidently has an artificial sweeteners in sucralose, perhaps it's also getting it's sweetness from the blackberry juice concentrate. Which brings up an interesting point . The drink is called black raspberry, but raspberry is not listed in the ingredients. Blackberry is listed. No matter, really, the main thing is that it's a quite good fruit-flavored drink essentially free of calories and  I enjoy the very low sweetness.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Some time ago, my wife came home with a small container of Mediterranean Sea Salt. I was somewhat taken back by the price, but it was an excellent salt, of that there was no question. Well, that salt is now almost gone, but we were wandering down the spice isle in our local warehouse store and there was a grinder/bottle of Kirkland Signature Mediterranean Sea Salt. Well, we just had to try it. As for the cost, the Kirkland salt was under half the cost on a per ounce basis.<br /><br />The Kirkland Signature Mediterranean Sea Salt is excellent. The flavor is bright and crisp and wonderful, just like the other sea salt we had. It's just marvelously salty! I wondered, what makes this stuff so good? After all it's just salt and salt should taste like salt no matter what. Yet, this Mediterranean Sea Salt is markedly better than our Diamond Crystal Salt which we have generally used for cooking as well as a table salt. Well, I looked at the Diamond Crystal list of ingredients. In addition to salt, there's sodium silicoalluminate, dextrose, potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate listed. Well, no wonder the salt tastes different! The Diamon Crystal salt is full of additives! I suppose Morton's is the same way, although I've not had a chance to check it. The only ingredient listed on the Kirkland Signature bottle is Mediterranean sea salt.<br /><br />Well, we're planning on using this as a table salt from here on out. Once you've experienced the taste, you just can't go back. Try it. You'll lke it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. They have a lot of gourmet items and I enjoy trying them. Some I don't care for and then there's these: La Panzanella Croccantina (Rosemary) in a 5.5-ounce box. I guess you might call them a cracker or hardbread. Very good! Delicious! They're lightly salted with sea salt and you can see the little crystals. They also have a light rosemary flavor and are made with olive oil. Everything about them says \"imported from Italy,\" but they're a USA product made in Tukwila, Washington. I'll be having more of these!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Just a short time ago I bought a box of Doctor Kracker crispbreads and they were so good I just had to come back and try another variety. This time I chose the Klassic 3 seed. Wow! These are really, really good  crispbreads, the best I've ever had. I had this one topped with shredded crabmeat and a little dab of cocktail sauce. Nice combination. I'm sure the crispbreads will go with all sorts of other  things. They're real fresh and crunchy and just delicious. I wonder how many varieties they make?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's a little item I picked up in a European Deli. It's 3AKYCOH  Gourmet Mustard. I believe it's Russian, but it comes to us from Zakuson in Toronto, Canada. Well, whatever, it's a real nice mustard. Zesty? Oh, yeah! Nice and hot but with real good flavor, not just heat. Most recently, I've been using it on turkey-roll sandwiches and it goes real well. It should work real well with a lot of other things also. It's brown in color, not that bright yellow stuff.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "If you're ever looking for a light snack to accompany watching television, a ball game or something like that, try David Pumpkin Seeds. They're lightly roasted, lightly salted and all natural. And they're delicious!<br /><br />Some people eat the entire seed, but I only eat the kernels. Thus, I have to crack each seed, extract the kernel and dispose of the hulls. This process can be somewhat time consuming, but like everything else, you get better and better with practice. Still, some people would regard this as a negative, but I would regard it as a positive. I can sometimes spend all evening consuming a delicious snack and watching TV and consume less than a single serving which amounts to 280 calories. Plus, seeds and nuts carry a heavy caloric load in general, to be sure, but they also carry a lot of vitamins, minerals, unsaturated vegetable fat and fiber. They may have calories, but they aren't empty calories! I worry a little about the salt content, but the David seeds are only lightly salted and I don't consume the entire seed.<br /><br />These David Pumpkin Seeds are a fine light snack. Prepare to get addicted. I'll bet you can't eat just one, or one pack. They can be a little hard to find, but finding large quantities online is easy. Good snacking!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Here's a real nice snack cracker. I picked them up at my nearby Fresh and Easy store. They're imported from Canada and are known as \"Milton's Corn Bread Baked Snack Crackers.\" Very good product. I had them yesterday for lunch with some kipper snacks. They're low in fat with no trans-fats and, as such, fairly low in calories. Also, they are not particularly salty as are so many snack crackers. They have a real nice corn bread taste and are quite fresh and crunchy. How did I ever miss these? The distributer is right here in nearby Carlsbad.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "During my last trip to our local grocery store, I picked up a Maruchan Yakisoba Noodle Bowl (sweet and sour chicken flavor) just out of curiosity, and I had it for a light lunch today. It was quite good and took only four minutes to prepare. The sweet and sour taste was very good. It was too high in sodium, of course, which is typical of these prepared bowls. Probably half the packet of flavoring is salt. So, I watch my salt intake for the rest of the day when I have one of these. On the other hand, it had 6 grams of protein, which was high for a dish like this. All in all, it made a good, but not a great, lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I'm on a very strict diet and am trying to lose about 30 pounds over a two-month period. So far, I'm down 14 and it hasn't been a month yet. I don't particularly like going hungry so I eat a lot but the stuff I eat is very low in calories (and high in fiber, I might add). It's about 90 % vegetarian except for a few sources of animal protein including Egg Beaters and Non-Fat Milk. Low calorie veggies are fairly east to find, the trick is to make them interesting. As such, I pick up a variety of pickled items. One is a large jar (32 ounces) of Frank's Quality Kraut. The smaller container shown here is exactly the same product, just a different container size. It's an excellent kraut. Fine tasting. Goes well with my other veggies and with my soy protein products. Plus, it's only five calories per serving. Can't beat it!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I had a half package of Garofalo Farfalle Whole Wheat Bow Tie Pasta in my pantry and It's so old I can't remember where I got it. Probably it goes back to when I shopped at Trader Joe's (about 5 years ago) and used to buy lots of their whole wheat pastas. No problem. The pasta was sealed in an air-tight container and showed no signs of age or deterioration. It's good to have things with such long shelf lives! In any case, it cooked up well in about 15 minutes and I mixed it with some creamy portobello mushroom soup. Mmmmm good. Nice mix. Delicious. Real good pasta, although I'm going to have to admit that I prefer the white to the whole wheat.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I recently picked up a few bottles of Zico coconut water with pineapple at my nearby grocery store. I was curious. I used to be an endurance athlete and I've read about things like this. It's loaded with potassium and other electrolytes and is fairly low in sodium and sugars. It would make a good replentishment drink and some might suggest it for people who suffer from cramps. Well I find it very bland in taste. That's okay. It has pineapple flavor added, but it's so low as to be almost unnoticeable. I prefer to drink it ice cold and that seems to diminish the bland taste. It's an interesting product. Endurance athletes who sweat a lot will appreciate it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I have a Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market only a short drive away and I buy a lot of groceries there. It's an English company ant they have a lot of exotic items that you generally don't find elsewhere, including English candies. So, I pick one up ever so often. One of the latest is a Toffee Crisp crispy crunch chewy munch bar. Mmmmm. It's good, Nice chocolate coating on the outside and both chewy and crunchy on the inside. Wonderful taste too. My wife says European candies are better than American and she's right!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I just recently visited my nearby Fresh and Easy Market and saw that they had added Hansen's Natural Coconut Water (in 11.2-ounce containers) to the available beverages. Well, I like coconut water and just had  to try it. Good. Very good. It's 100% coconut water from concentrate. Nothing else. And it has a nice fresh coconut taste. Loaded with potassium too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I recently visited my local warehouse store and picked up a two-pack (45 oz each) of KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce. It's much too much, of course, but this stuff has a long shelf life and we use it with all kinds of things. For example, when I got home I put a mini Crock Pot full of small meat balls and dowsed it with a generous amount of this sauce. When the pot was hot, we used it as the main dish of the evening meal. Mmmmm. Delicious! Very nice flavor. It's definitely one of the better \"barbecue sauce in a bottle\" products available. Handy stuff to have around too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked tomato-based sauces on my foods. Ketchup, seafood cocktail sauce, chile sauce and salsa are all in my cabinets. They can brighten up a host of different foods. I particularly like salsas, and my favorites are fresh salsas. However, there's always a preservation problem. As such, I usually have a couple jars of salsa in my pantry This week, I found some bottled Kirkland Signature medium organic salsa on my trip to our local Costco Store. Well, I hadn't noticed this before and it must be something new. I had to try it.<br /><br />This Kirkland Organic Salsa is quite good, just about the best bottled salsa I can remember. Good flavor. The right amount of zest for me. A nice fine-chunky texture. I tried it on some ravioli last night and on a plate of scrambled eggs this morning. Excellent! It's good I like it because with two 38-ounce bottles, there's a lot of it. I'm not worried. It won't last long. This is good stuff!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "My young boy (4-years old) loves chocolate milk. Whenever he requests a  drink I offer him chocolate milk rather than some sweetened beverage. That seems to work well and gives him a variety of needed nutrients rather than a lot of sugar. Down it goes. Every time. The problem has been keeping enough of it around. Then I was in Costco a couple weeks ago and I spotted cases of Kirkland Signature Organic (reduced fat) Chocolate Milk (24-8.25 ounce cartons). That would work fine, and it doesn't need to be stored in the fridge, except for a few carton for immediate drinking. He loves it. Great idea!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've been trying a variety of organic products from Amy's Kitchen. In general, I'm very pleased. This evening I had a can of Amy's Organic Soup of the Vegetable Barley variety. It was excellent and went well with the other things of the meal. I thought the taste was delicious, if a little on the bland side. To counter this, I gave it a couple twists on my peppercorn mill and that did the trick. I love the all organic vegetable ingredients plus the barley and I appreciate the ultra-low fat and no cholesterol content. The soup was very low in calories at 70 per serving so having two servings didn't bother me at all. To me, the sodium is a little high, but within reason. Have you ever checked some of the other soups? This was good. It will be on my list to replentish.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked hot sauces, salsas and spicey foods . Tabasco was my first choice in hot sauces originally and I still enjoy it now and then. But then I discovered several different wonderful brands of Louisiana Pepper sauces and I grew to like them better than Tabasco. Then one day when a store didn't have any Louisiana brands available, I picked up a small bottle of Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper sauce as a temporary substitute. It was made in New Jersey. New Jersey? I thought all hot sauces of any quality came from the Gulf Coast States. This stuff just couldn't be any good!<br /><br />Well, surprise! This stuff is a very good hot sauce. In fact, it is better than most of the Louisiana hot sauces I have tried, and it is less expensive. It'll brighten up any number of dishes, especially things that come with tomato sauce. I use it along with ketchup anywhere I'd use ketchup alone. Delicious!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I picked up a 4-ounce box of \"Wisecrackers\" at my local grocery. I think I bought them because the name amused me. Well, they probably are \"wise\" because they are low fat and have no saturated or trans fats. No sugars either. I should add that my variety was the Roasted Garlic Rosemary variety and I had some of them with a can of smoked oysters. Nice combination, although they should go with a wide variety of things. They're nice and crisp and have a nice very light flavor. I'll be looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I first saw Mexican Coca-Cola at my local warehouse store. What is this, I wondered? Then I read an article about it and the story about how American Coke had been gradually changed and no longer was made with cane sugar. It seems that the U.S. Coke is made with corn syrup. Mexican Coke was said to be like the old-fashioned American Coke I knew and loved as a kid, so it seems. Actually, I preferred Pepsi and you got twice as much for your dime. Well, I just had to try Mexican Coke and I bought a case. It's quite delicious, and is indeed better than the Coca-Cola generally purchased in the U.S. I suppose you could say that it's gourmet Coca-Cola.<br /><br />In any case, I seldom drink anything except diet soft drinks because of a calorie problem I have. However, I have friends, relatives and guests that won't drink diet drinks. So, I always have a few bottles of Mexican Coke in the fridge. I offer it with a slight explanation and people seem to love it. They're almost always amazed. The novelty is worth the extra price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago I discovered LU Petit Ecolier (Little Schoolboy) biscuits covered with a chocolate wafer. They came in three kinds: milk chocolate, dark chocolate and very-dark (70% cocoa) chocolate. Personally, I prefer the dark chocolate so I opted for a box of the very-dark chocolate variety. Oh, these were just sensationally good! I told my wife about them and had her try one. She liked it, but said she greatly preferred milk chocolate to the real dark stuff. Okay, it's a matter of taste. This time I bought a box of the milk chocolate ones to see if it would please her. It did. She preferred them and thought they were very good. Well, I'm sorry folks. I think the real dark ones are clearly superior and that's that! Actually, they're both excellent and it's just a matter of what you want (and who's rating it).<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I noticed this six-bar box of Clif Kid Z Bar (chocolate chip) in the nutrition bar section of my nearby grocery store. Hmmm. Made for kids with ingredients that matter. Well, I had to get a box to try out on my four-year-old boy. He seems to like things that come in a bar shape and I'd like to get some proper nutrition in him. This looks like the ticket, if he'll eat them. He's at the grandparents now, so a try will have to wait. Well, I'll give one a try. Hey, these aren't bad at all. Nice dark chocolate flavor. Nice granular texture. These things are a good bar. If the boy won't eat them, they won't last long around here.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our boy is eleven-months old today. He's now got six teeth (4 uppers, 2 lowers) and we're giving him more and more solid foods. My wife spots items like these Graduates Mini Fruits and just has to try them out. The boy loves them and puts a good effort into chewing them up. The only problem we've had is that if he is given more than one at a time he tries to get all of them in his mouth at once. So far there's been no choking problems, but we worry. In any case, he loves them and the small treat will often quiet him down when he's cranky.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "These are nifty little packets of applesauce, in this case, apple and mango. I discovered these a couple months ago and they work very well for two different circumstances. First,  they make a real good healthy snack for my four-year-old boy, and he loves them. Second, I take them along as a snack for my daily walks. A single pack slides easily into a pant pocket and is easy to drain without the need for any cup or spoon or anything. Just take the top off and apply a mild sucking pressure to the opening. The packet is drained before you even realize it. Plus these things are delicious! I but them in boxes of 16 3.2-ounce  packets at a nearby Costco store.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "One of my Amazon reviewer friends called my attention to birch beer after I had posted a review of Mexican Coca Cola (surprisingly good, by the way). I had heard of birch beer in the distant past, but hadn't seen it or reference to it for at least 3-4 decades. I guess it was one of those old fashioned things that had largely faded away. Out of curiosity, I stopped in at the local Bevmo store and there was a variety of birch beers. Ibought a couple bottles of Sioux City Birch Bear, just to give it a try. Well, it's old fashioned, all right, coming in bottles, but modern in having the newer twist-off caps. I looked at the ingredients and was dismayed to find High Fructose Corn Syrup listed. I expected all cane sugar. I also noticed artificial flavoring and coloring. Hmmmmm. What's so old fashioned here? I drank the sodas. It was a nice refreshing taste that reminded me of a weak, watery root beer. I was also surprised that it had very little carbonation. Is this the way birch beer is supposed to taste? I'm somewhat disappointed. I doubt if I'll buy any more of this brand, but I may well try some other brand.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Several weeks ago I discovered Izze fruit drinks starting with the Blackberry variety. It was so good I tried the Pomegranate. That was good too, so now I have a four-pack of the Clementine variety. It tastes like a weak orange soda with a good sharp tartness. I like it much better than the typical orange soda pop and it's made with 70% fruit juices and no added sugars. It's just like having a slightly carbonated fruit juice rather than darkly-colored sugar water. That's my kind of drink. Excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "According to my doctor, I'm supposed to do more walking to strengthen my bones. Okay, I can do that. I've even gotten to the point where I enjoy it. I have a little route worked out that is about 1 1/2 miles and I try to do it on a daily basis, if possible. There's a drinking fountain along the way for these hot summer days. However, I prefer to carry my own cold beverage and I've tried a variety of different drinks. Today, I brought SoBe Lifewater O Calories (black and blueberry variety) in a 20-ounce bottle. That worked well. The taste was good and I like the no added artificial sweeteners. I like all the added vitamins and antioxidants. The size of the drink was just about ideal. I'll be doing this again and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Last week I tried an item referred to as Popchips. They were excellent. So, on my next trip back to the store I picked up a three-ounce bag of Popchips Sour Cream and Onion Potato chips. They're low in fat and have very low sodium content for a snack chip. They're free of preservatives, cholesterol and artificial flavors or colors. Amazing! It's a good tasting snack chip without all those nasty ingredients that most chips have. Oh, and these sour cream and onion ones are just delicious.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Our toddler went on a visit to the grandparents last week. When they brought him back they brought along a gallon of whole milk and a container of Nestle Nesquick Strawberry Powder Drink Mix. They said he liked the drink mix. Well, I don't doubt that. The kid just loves milk of any kind. I've never found a taste enhancer to be necessary.<br /><br />I'm probably not going to be using the strawberry drink mix. Right on the front of the container it states that it is 25% less sugar. Hmmmm. Less than what? Out of curiosity, I turned the packet around and found out that sugar was the only food ingredient, if you count sugar as a food. All other ingredients are additives. Well, why should I be giving my kid heaps of additives including sugar with his food when he already loves the pure milk? Our doctor told us to cut down on the boy's sugar intake. All this does is add to it. Oh sure, it might supply a few extra vitamins and minerals but, let's face it, the only food ingredient in this product is sugar. Look over the nutrients yourself, if you like. On the back of the package, it even states that when mixed with low-fat milk, the resulting mix is filled with protein, carbohydrates and happiness. Well, I don't know about the happiness, but all the protein and carbohydrates are coming from the milk, not the sugar-based mixing powder. Personally, when I'm in charge, he's going to be getting the pure milk.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "Not too long ago, I bought a packet of Hansen's Junior Water and liked it very much. It was a good drink and had some fruit juice and a little sugar. It was light and somewhat sweet, but not too much. Just fine for our little boy (4-years old). Junior Water for Junior, so to speak. Well, now I needed another batch so this time I got the fruit punch variety. Nice light taste. Just right. His doctor warned us not to give him too heavily sugared drinks. These work well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I shop for groceries at a nearby Fresh and Easy store. They're a British company and carry a lot of imported items, particularly things from England. I've discovered their European candies. My wife is from Russia and has also lived in London and she says that European candies are better than American. Boy, is she right! In any  case, the latest item for me to pick up is a roll of Rowntrees Fruit Pastilles. They're little round discs, about the size of a nickel but about twice as thick, and are covered with somewhat coarsely granulated sugar crystals. They're not particularly sweet, I should add. Inside is a tough, very chewy candy. The flavor is not overly strong, unlike American things of this kind, but is soft and subtle and very, very good. A roll of these has three or four different flavors within it. Boy, are these things good. Gracious! I start out with the idea of having one or two, but the whole roll is gone in no time. Ummmmm. Beware if you're on any kind of a diet. These things are awesome!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I've always liked jelly beans and my wife has also. I never thought much about the different brands until I heard many years ago that President Ronald Reagan's favorite brand was Jelly Belly. Out of curiosity, I tried them. They were excellent! They were  smaller, quite brightly flavored and more expensive. In any case, I quite enjoyed them but we try to keep our consumption low. We try to eat (or serve) very little candy and when we serve it or eat it, the candy has to be first rate.<br /><br />Well, my wife and I were wandering the isles of our local warehouse store and there was a big display of Kirkland Signature Jelly Belly jelly beans. They came in four-pound jars and were much less expensive than the small packets we usually bought. How could we resist? They were excellent, just as we expected. The variety of flavors is incredible. Some people like to pick out types of all one kind and others just dip in and chew a mouthful to see what happens. I happen to be one of the latter. We keep the jar of jelly beans around mainly for guests and special events such as Halloween and birthdays, but now and then the temptation is just too much and we modestly indulge. They're really much too tasty!<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "I enjoy trying new things and my nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store has a lot of them. Recently, I picked up some Guayaki Yerba Mate Enlighten Mint drink. Well, I've never had anything quite like it. The drink has a slightly sour taste, but has a somewhat refreshing minty aftertaste. It's quite good and goes down easily. Very pleasant. The calorie count is modest and it only has 14 grams of sugar in a 16-ounce can. I drink it ice cold, but without added ice. The can says it's a powerful rainforest experience, and I'm not certain what that entails. We'll see. This  stuff is good enough that I won't stop at one. Mmmmm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",
      "About a week ago I was shopping in the fancy cookies and crackers section of our local grocery store and I found these 4.25-ounce boxes of Ak-Mak Sesame Crackers. Well, it was like finding an old friend. I've been using these things for years and years but I lost track of them upon changing stores several times. They are delicious. They're real crisp and crunchy and have an excellent sesame seed taste, along with whole wheat. They're low in fat and with no cholesterol. They contain no sugar and have a very low sodium content for a cracker. Plus they have some protein and a goodly amount of fiber. What more could you ask for in a cracker? I've often used them as a bread substitute, and they're much more nutritious than most breads. Did I mention they have a great taste?<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n"

      "I love these cookies!  Not only are they healthy but they taste great and are so soft!  I will definitely add these to my grocery list!\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:<br /><br />--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I'd had a relatively \"healthy\" start to the day.<br /><br />--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.<br /><br />--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!\n",
      "I am usually not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these literally melt in your mouth. They are so soft and tasty! I would definitely recommend these to someone who loves oatmeal, and even those like me who would probably pick a different flavor over this one.\n",
      "I participated in a product review that included a sample of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH8M\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.  Okay first of all I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies and this one was no exception.  It was great!!! Soft n chewy, nice portion size and and as always a high quality product from Quaker Oats.  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster to for including this in their Mom Voxbox.  If you haven't tried it you need to and make sure to share it with the family.\n",
      "My kids loved these. I was very pleased to give my kids a quick on the go healthy snack before soccer and acne practice. They loved the flavor, I loved that its healthy.\n",
      "I really enjoyed these individually wrapped big oatmeal cookies. They are really soft and chewy. You can buy different flavors. I will definately be repurchasing these cookies in the future. They are delicious and super healthy too.\n",
      "I was surprised at how soft the cookie was. I usually buy Little Debbie's cookies, and I noticed the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was bigger and had a bold taste.\n",
      "Filled with oats and raisins you'll love this snack ..... Delicious and nutritious ..... what else is there to say.... you can't beat that....\n",
      "I was recently given a complimentary \"vox box\" from influenster, call the mom vox box. It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie \"raisins\" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets\n",
      "the best and freshest cookie that comes in a package, we ate them up, wishing we had more. soo good\n",
      "I am a huge fan of the Quaker Chewy cookies! The moist cookies are satisfying and not too sweet. The high quality ingredients are a crowd pleaser. A must have for any car trip! After one cookie I was hooked. Highly recommend!\n",
      "yummy and delicious. i love eating it when it when its warm. the best store bought cookies! cant wait to buy more!\n",
      "I received a Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie to try/eat for free from Influenster [...]). I shared the cookie with my kids, and we gobbled up the cookie faster than you can say \"Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookies.\" It was soft (as advertised) and included a sufficient amount of raisins to make me happy (I like raisins). It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)\n",
      "These cookies were so good. Can't wait to go out and buy some more! A good snack when you don't want to over-indulge yourself\n",
      "I received these in my MomVox box from influenster! I loved it! Oatmeal cookies are my favorite and these are by far the best store bought brand I have tasted! I recommend these to anyone with a sweet tooth trying to stay healthy.\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies taste just like the cookies my grandma used to bake. Great to take as a quick breakfast since it is made with whole grain Quaker Oats.\n",
      "These cookies are a real hit with my children! I received a sample from @Influenster in my Mom Vox Box. I enjoyed the sweetness, yet whole grain taste (which I love) and the moist raisins. This cookie would be perfect for breakfast, snack, or dessert! What could be better than that?! I love these cookies and definitely will be buying more!\n",
      "I really enjoy Quaker's products and the fact that they are more healthy than most other products. These were really good especially if you like raisins.\n",
      "This was the most delightful cookie i ever tasted. I was very surprised on how soft and fresh it tasted. It makes a great snack on the go as well! I tried the chocolate almond as well and YUMMY! Quaker hit  this one out of the park!\n",
      "Quaker used some good ingredients in the cookie and one cookie eaten amongst four kids did not meet the nutritional panel for one cookie. Even if one cookie was eaten by them each the nutritional panel was pretty good.  So, I can be a happy mom about the children eating the cookie\n",
      "My daughter stole it from me and ate it, I guess it's a good thing I can't stand oatmeal.  But both my kids are already huge fans of all things Quaker so it's easy for me to write this review.<br /><br />Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are chewy, nutrition and according to my kids, DELICIOUS.  They are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats, individually packaged at $2.69 for a box of 6, is a good source of fiber, only contains 6 grams of total fat per cookie and sold pretty much EVERYWHERE!\n",
      "I loved this delicious cookie! I even shared it with my 11 month old, and I'm a pretty big health nut when it comes to what I feed my daughter. It tasted great, was a great portion and it's not full of fats and sugars like all of those other cookies!\n",
      "I enjoy these cookies... They taste like my grandmas homeade cookies.. Plump and super soft!!! I can't wait to try the other favors made by quacker.l\n",
      "These cookies have perfect flavor, excellent moist/dry combination and are very soft. They melt in your mouth. I love the taste, I could eat box after box!\n",
      "Received this through VoxBox and loved it. My son ended up with most of it, which is fine. Excellent product to keep on hand or in the diaper bag.\n",
      "I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade \"vanishing oatmeal\" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie.\n",
      "I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these oatmeal cookies, they were delicious. It is a great go to snack when you are out and about and need something quick... and the kids love them!\n",
      "This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins\n",
      "I received a free sample of these cookies through Influenster and immediately got hooked on them. They're are so soft, perfect for anytime but specially for breakfast. My son loved them even though he doesn't like Oatmeal. I had to purchase more and now we treat ourselves every morning to a yummy cookie.\n",
      "I loved the texture, the natural taste, and the softness was just right!!! If you are wanting a good cookie to take o the go, or for anytime, this is a very good choice!!\n",
      "First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar.\n",
      "These are nice soft, spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor.  They are a perfect single serving size, in a perfect individual wrap.  They have a good taste, natural, not artificial and are a satisfying snack.  I would buy these to take for a snack or lunch.\n",
      "Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.  Not like homemade but very good for store bought.\n",
      "i was surprised i liked it! i normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were sooo soft and chewy. it was delicious. i shared one with my daughter and she wolfed it down!\n",
      "Oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite but I do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie.  The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but 170 for one cookie sure isn't diet food.<br /><br />2 stars.\n",
      "WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, \"Mommy, can I have more?\" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies. I was very impressed with the packaging and how SOFT the cookies really were when you opened them and the flavor that they had. Very Impressive. Would definitely buy!\n",
      "Quaker products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.<br /><br />There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at: 170 calories, 6g of fat, 27g carbohydrates, 4 g dietary fiber, 12g sugar, and 2g protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.<br /><br />For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, Quaker's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!\n",
      "This is more than just a cookie. It is a guilty pleasure. Except that you dont have to feel guilty because it is good for you. It is so soft and fresh you would think your grandma just baked it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!\n",
      "I received a sample pack of the Raisin variety of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster to test out with my family.<br /><br />My 22 month old son loved the cookie and almost ate the whole thing himself. I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!\n",
      "The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them.\n",
      "My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy.\n",
      "Quaker, which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness.\n",
      "After trying these cookies for the first time, i am hooked and dont feel guilty because they are delicious. Thanks Quaker for another awesome product.\n",
      "In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But \"healthier\" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K\">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging.\n",
      "I received 1 to try out and wasn't to sure what to expect. they are delicious i have to say, will definatly be buying more\n",
      "Love these cookies my Son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about 15 sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel...I always make sure to keep in stock in my home...they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag\n",
      "These cookies are so soft and tasty. I love the texture of the cookie!! I will definitely be eating these cookies as a snack for lunch.\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something.\n",
      "TOTALLY DIFFERENT!<br />chewy, soft-baked cookie, Healthier alternative,<br />Individually packaged / Good for on the go!<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Great Healthier snack for all the family!<br /><br />I don't like oatmeal & raisins... but this cookie really taste great! :D\n",
      "It is nice to have a cookie that my kids enjoy and I don't have to worry about it being unhealthy. I was very happy to receive this in my Influenster Mom Voxbox!\n",
      "I was very surprised how soft they were. I gave one to my kids and they loved them. Definitely getting more for them!\n",
      "These are great on the go treats for adults, and the kids too - if you wanna share ;)<br />They're bursting with flavor and nutritious to boot.\n",
      "totally my kids favorite cookie so good soft not so much sweet exactly one that i want to give my kid\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are now my favorite cookies.  They are so soft and delicious.  And I love how they come individually wrapped so I don't have to worry about the rest of them going stale.<br />I definitely recommend giving these cookies a try - you'll be glad you did!\n",
      "I got a sample of these from Influenster, and I went out and bought more right away.  These are the softest and tastiest packaged cookies I've had.  I love the flavor, Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my favorite.  Even though they are cookies, I feel like I could be doing a lot worse health-wise than these.\n",
      "I received a sample package of this product complimentary from [...]  to try. I must say, it was super yummy. The cookies are large enough to satisfy my sweet tooth yet small enough that i didn't feel like I was gorging myself either. Best part is, they are healthy enough that i don't mind feeding them to my kiddos as a special treat.\n",
      "Love the soft baked cookies, tastes great and I don't feel guilty eating this cookie. They are also individually wrapped so it's great for throwing in a bag for hiking or in kid's lunch. I tried the oatmeal raisin and must say it's my favorite, apparently many others favorites as I can never found them on the shelves.\n",
      "I got the influenster box and it had several products in it.  My kids loved the quaker soft bake cookie.  would get some if I were you\n",
      "Cookie was so soft and my son acutally loved it and he really doesnt like a lot of item. I really love this cookie and i did purchase again.\n",
      "my kids and i enjoyed the Quaker Soft Baked cookies.  they are great for lunch boxes and for snacks at home or on the go.  i loved the soft baked texture and fresh taste.\n",
      "This is a great tasting cookie.  Portion size is close to perfect.  Soft texture with almost homemade flavor.  What a find?!?! I love these cookies!\n",
      "Quaker always surprises me with all their wonderful products which are satisfying for the whole family. I really love these Oatmeal soft baked cookies!! They are made from whole grain quaker oats and have a wonderful flavor! I can't wait to buy more of these and other yummy products!\n",
      "I really enjoyed these cookies. They tasted fresh & homemade and very soft and chewy.....I will purchase again, definitely a favorite!\n",
      "I just love the oatmeal raisein cookie it was super soft and delicious, i was amazed by the amount of raisens in it because there usually isnt enough in other brands. Not only did i love this cookie but my daughter loved it so much i had to go out and buy a box of them. Id def. reccomend these to any cookie lover, im a fan for life.\n",
      "These are so yummy. They taste just like my grandmas homestyle cookies. They are a perfect texture, just enough sweetness, and leave you craving for more! I can't get enough of them. I eat them with a nice glass of cold milk and it's heaven!\n",
      "These are really good.  I love raisin cookies and this one did not dissapoint me.  It is soft and they are in individual packs.  I got it free from Influenster to try and liked it.\n",
      "These cookies would be better if they were made with rolled oats instead of oat flour. The crumbly and mealy texture does not provide an enjoyable experience.\n",
      "This cookie is full of flavor and at a great price.  I got a sample free in the mail, and will be buying more for my son!  We both loved them.\n",
      "This cookie was moist chewy and delicious.  Both my daughter and I thought it was fabulous and I will definitely buy in the future.\n",
      "This is pretty good for a store bought cookie! It was nice and soft, not too sweet. Just right. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars because I like my cookies a little chewy. Overall great cookie! I got one of these cookies as a sample from @influenster.\n",
      "This cookie was really good... I liked the single serve packaging and the portability of the product! great for on the go and not loaded with junk!\n",
      "I am very impressed with the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They are a healthier cookie and have a great taste. Very soft and melt in your mouth.\n",
      "It's not too sweet so I like that. The kids love it and let's face it, cookies are generally not healthy, so this is ok, not the healthiest, but good!\n",
      "These cookies are delicious, a little messy but have a great taste, my kids also enjoyed them, it is a lunch bag must have.\n",
      "These are so soft and really yummy. I like that I can grab a pouch and toss it in my purse for an afternoon snack.\n",
      "I'm not a lover of oatmeal raisin cookies, but this one surprised me! I loved how soft and flavorful it was. YUM. I highly recommend. I got these as a sample from Influensters!\n",
      "I love these. They taste great and they are easy to throw in your bag and bring a long with you for a snack for yourself or a child. My 3 year old liked the taste as well. I do think they are a bit pricey but they are full of whole grains which is better than normal cookies.\n",
      "My son and I both LOVED these cookies, very yummy and delicious.  My son ate them so quickly that I hardly got any LOL.  I really like the texture of the cookies, and they are quite filling.\n",
      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster, and it was a big hit.  Soft, chewy, and tasty.  Only thing I would change about it is that it doesn't travel very well because it gets too crumbly.\n",
      "The Quaker Oatmeal Raisin cookies could not be more delicious! They have that homemade taste w/out all the mess!! I was surprised at how soft they were and you could really taste cinnamon and other flavors, they did not taste processed.  The most important thing- my kids loved them too!\n",
      "I got to try these through Influenster. Though I'd planned to buy my own, I'm glad I had to do it for the site, because otherwise I wouldn't have tried the Oatmeal Raisin. I'm not a fan of the combo. I don't know why.<br />But, Quaker did a great job. There was the perfect combination of oatmeal to raisin, and I didn't feel like I was tasting cardboard, as I tend to with oatmeal cookies. Instead, it was super moist, and honestly, if it had been hot, I would have assumed it was straight from the oven. Just perfectly done!\n",
      "warm these up and they taste like you just pulled them out of the oven ... love love love these. My kids also really really enjoyed these .... my 5 year old thought they were home made !\n",
      "These cookies are not only yummy but they are good for you. My children love them too. Its a great snack for them and I don't feel guilty giving it to them. Try one!!\n",
      "I do not like Oatmeal raisin cookies, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the soft texture and the taste of these cookies. I would recommend these if you love oatmeal raisin cookies.\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised with this cookie. It has a great flavor and was nice and moist! My three year old daughter loved it also!\n",
      "This cookie was very good, but a little dry for my taste! I would also prefer it to taste more like a homemade cookie with more raisins.\n",
      "It's amazing!  Love the taste and texture!! awesome price!! My 3 year old loved it and she is a HARD SELL!!\n",
      "Great taste and packaging. Perfect for lunch boxes and take along snacks. We have enjoyed these cookies and look forward to more flavors.\n",
      "Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only \"fortifications\" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%).\n",
      "These cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and I think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  The cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste.\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was given to me to sample through Influenster Mom Vox box program.  It tasted like it was home baked.  I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my 14 year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too.\n",
      "Quaker Cookies for me is that one in the package is suffice for me with a cup of tea or hot cocoa. Usually I go digging for a few more cookies to conquer my sweet tooth but not this time.\n",
      "This is a really good cookie! DIdnt really think that I would like a cookie from a company known for its oatmeal, but completely surprised!! It was soft and soooo chewy! Really good served warm & with a cold glass of milk!\n",
      "I tried this cookie (which came free in my Mom Vox Box 2012) and I fell in love with it! My kids and my husband liked it, too! It is soft and chewy with a delicious home-baked taste. We will definitely include this in our stash of healthy goodies & snacks!\n",
      "I wasn't sure if I was gonna like these until I received a free sample and fell in love with it. These cookies are so soft and yummy. My 5 year old loved it. Can't get enough of it.\n",
      "I originally purchased these cookies at the store and then being an influenster I received a sample of the Oatmeal Raisin Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. These make a great snack for kids and adults alike. These are great to carry in a diaper bag for that lil pick me up when out and about. They have so many flavors and styles of there new soft baked. They are soft but not crumbly, easy to eat not to chewy, they are filling and satsfying.\n",
      "I'm not a fan of oatmeal or raisins (lol) but I wanted to taste the cookie before I gave it to my daughter. So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.<br /><br />**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  But if I had to grade this with the price that Amazon has it for, I would probably give it 1 star!  A 6-pack of these cookies is $2.69 so why is a 12-pack almost $35 on here?! Am I missing something, lol**\n",
      "These soft cookies are very tasty and have a great texture. They are just the right size for an afternoon snack.\n",
      "I have only tried Quaker Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were not my favorite, however Im still in love with their Oatmeal cereals and granola!\n",
      "Ok so I love oatmeal cookies they are amazing. And this is one that I approve on for its soft gooey and chewy. It is absolutely amazing. I love it, and would recommend it to anyone that loves oatmeal, and the raisins are sweet they do not taste tart and are not overpowering.\n",
      "I love oatmeal raisin cookies, really love them.  So, I am always on the lookout for a good cookie...especially if they are made by someone other than me.  When I got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said \"Why not?\"  The cookies come 6 to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy.\n",
      "I was pleasently surprised about how soft this cookie was.  It had great flavor, I couldnt even tell there were raisins in the cookie, which is great because I dont normally like raisins.  I like that they come individually wrapped so that all the cookies don't dry out when you want to eat one.  Great snack to take on the go!\n",
      "Theses cookies are yummy and soft even with raisins my toddler likes them. My only problem is one cookie had 170 calories and is not remotely filling. It's not the healthiest snack but it sure is tasty!\n",
      "Love single served cookies and they are a perfect as a pick-me up. I don't cookies in the house, but this one can stay all wrapped and waiting for the perfect moment\n",
      "QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils).\n",
      "I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, \"store bought\" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT \"low calorie\", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly \"good\" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to \"homemade cookies\".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie.\n",
      "The folks at Quaker really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.<br /><br />I would have liked more raisins, I couldn't hear \"it thru the grapevine\".<br /><br />Good nutrition for a cookie.\n",
      "Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are \"moist\" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!\n",
      "The box says, \"soft baked oatmeal cookies\" and that is exactly what you get!  The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for \"on the go\" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!\n",
      "Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies.\n",
      "This oatmeal cookie was delicious - soft, full of raisins and not too sweet or sugary.  Full of whole grain, I feel confident eating this cookie and giving it to my family to eat as well.  Great item to have in the bag for a quick snack that feels like a treat and is filling too!  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster for introducing me to this product!\n",
      "Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!\n",
      "me and my kids loves this.. so soft and healthy and soooo good... easy packed and grab and go... I cant stop one just one... lol\n",
      "These cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  While they are 170 calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  They are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  They are almost as good as mom used to make!\n",
      "I sampled this product for the Influenster Mom Vox Box that I received in the mail.  I am purchase Quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the Quaker brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis.\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins were so moist with a fresh baked taste.  They had just the right amount of raisins to make them taste just like home made cookies.\n",
      "I recieved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal and Raisins Cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012. My husband and kids devoured the cookie before I had a chance to look at it or taste it. So this is what they thought of the cookie. It was sooooo good according to my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. He is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. I gave this product a 5 star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!\n",

      "I like soft cookies, but most of the ones you buy taste \"fake\".  Really enjoyed the Quaker Soft Baked with Raisins.  I recieved a sample in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and loved it.  I buy them to use as quick snacks, taste sweet and delicious but are healthier than other options.\n",
      "Quaker made with whole grain oats very soft ,healthy &  have rasin naturally flavored ,healthy product. Have iron 8% , fiber 4 Grams also calcium 4%.\n",
      "This cookie was very moist but it did not crumble when you took it out of the package.  It was full of flavor but it didn't satisfy your snack hunger.  I will definitely be buying more of these\n",
      "They are really soft and somewhat fresh tasting but i thought they had to many raisins.i dont think i would buy again.\n",
      "I received a sample (Oatmeal & Raisin) from my Mom VoxBox and love it. Not to sweet and very moist...just right.\n",

      "I got the opportunit to try Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster in my Mom VOX BOX.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chewy, soft-baked cookies made with wholesome Quaker Oats and delicious raisins. They are cookie and not as moist as a bar, but wonderful none the less. They offer the following benefits:<br /><br /> -Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving\n",
      "They are awesome and addictive with cold milk. Perfect snack on the go. A little expensive for single serving one pack but, worth it:)\n",
      "My kids absolutely love these cookies and theyre healthy too! and as a mom i dont mind my children eating these!\n",
      "As part of Influenster I received a Mom VoxBox full of great products to try and review.  Included was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie.  I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)\n",
      "This is one of the best tasting, soft cookies we had in a very long time!  The kids were fighting over who had the last one!\n",
      "these cookies are very soft and moist.. my kids love them!! my kids cant wait til i buy them again!!\n",
      "I have to say they are good. Not the same as if you made them your self. If you like quaker you'll love them.\n",
      "My boys ask for these cookies over and over. Of course, its easy to buy them for my family when they are so healthy for them! The fact that they taste fantastic doesn't hurt at all!\n",
      "We received some of these in our Influenster boxes and it is my opinion that they are sooooo good! I highly recommend for children and adults! :)\n",
      "this product was affordable, great texture, good nutrition and perfect taste. i will definitely purchase again. i received it through the influenster program and am very grateful to have been introduced to a alternative to my keebler cookies and oreos with a much more beneficial eating experience.\n",
      "I love these cookies ! My kids love them too I had to fight them just to get a bite.  I would recommend these to anyone\n",
      "I enjoy the fact that they are so soft and taste homemade.. No after taste like alot of cookies or oatmeal cookies.. And its healthy instead of a lot of sugar and empty cals\n",
      "Great when you're in the mood for a good, filling cookie! They are soft and tase great, and they're better than chocolate chip especially for kids.\n",
      "My family and I tried the Soft Bake Oatmeal Cookies and we loved them. I personally like to put them in the microwave for a couple of seconds to warm them; then it is just like a fresh baked cookie!\n",
      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie and oh em GEE.  This was a cookie that was just as good as the ones my Grandma used to make when I was little.  I shared half with my son and he kept saying MMMMM MMMM mommy MMMMM!  Highly recommend this cookie to anyone!\n",
      "I loved how the cookie was nice and soft when I opened the packaging. It seemed to be made of fresher ingredients. I decided to split the cookie in two and let the kids each have one side. I had to split it because the package only had one cookie in it. My daughter devoured it, my son...he saw there were raisin's in it and freaked out. K ended up eating her brother's half as well. I was bugged for days by her for another cookie so she must have loved it since that's how 3yr olds express love for food! (I WANT MORE COOKIE!)<br />I didn't get a chance to personally try the cookie, but over all it seemed good and from a brand that I like and trust, it also smelled pretty yummy!\n",
      "this cookie is amazing i couldnt think of a better snack for my daughter during the day to give her  it healthy and it taste great  and i loved how soft the cookie was\n",

      "Received these in my Influenster box for Summer, taste great and very soft. Seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost.\n",
      "These cookies tastes so good. If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave before eating, they taste like they just came out of the oven. Very fresh!\n",
      "My family and I tried this cookie and we all had different responses. I thought it was too sweet and did not taste like I home baked cookie. My husband thought it was too dry and crumbly and my son thought it was yummy.... he is 9.\n",
      "I only got to eat one little bite of my sample from Influenster because my son stole it and ate it!  Ha ha but the bite that I did have was amazing.  I will be getting more of these to keep in the house.\n",
      "Quaker wins again with these delicious cookies.  I was particularly loving the individually wrapped aspect of the oatmeal raisin cookies.  I hate opening a box and having half of the cookies go stale because the air gets to them.  These are so easy to throw into your bag or just grab one when you want and they are always fresh, soft and yummy.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed trying out the Quaker soft-baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies as part of the Influenster program.  The cookie was moist, soft, chewy... everything an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  The taste was superb - just the right amount of cinnamon & nutmeg - and it was super filling and held me over perfectly until dinner time.  When I tried them out, I was 8 months pregnant and constantly hungry, so for a cookie to be able to hold me over for that long... color me impressed!\n",
      "Awesome cookies . Great snack to have in the cupboard when you want something quick and sweet. The quality is amazing , worth every penny and then some.\n",
      "I love these cookies, I will have to hide them from the kids because although they would be easy to throw into a lunch box they are nice and healthy for a cheat every now and then.\n",
      "I just got done reviewing the quaker soft baked cookie line via @influenster and #momvox! They were absolutely amazing! Soft and moist perfect snack for adults and kids the same.\n",
      "I HAVE A SON WHO IS VERY PICKY AND HE LOVES SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES. I RECEIVED A FREE COOKIE FROM INFLUENSTER AND HE TOOK IT, I TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS HEALTHY FOR HIM BUT HE WANTED TO EAT IT ANY WAYS AND HE LOVED IT. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT 3 BOXES OF QUAKER COOKIES FOR MY KIDS.\n",
      "It was very tasty and soft. It was a little dry for me but my 7 year old loved it. I have a glass of milk with the cookie and it is a nice treat.\n",
      "I received this product to test courtesy of Influenster and Quaker and I have to say they are a hit in my house. This was the first product we tried out of the 5 we were sent to test and it lasted less then ten minutes in my home. My toddler was anxious to give them a try and I have already purchased two more boxes since we tasted the first one. They will definitely be a staple product. I love that they are from a trusted brand and I love that they are made with whole grains and I can feel good about my snack choice!\n",
      "Delicious and perfect for on the go. Kids love them and they're healthy for them too. I like how they taste home-baked and are soft and chewy. You can even heat them up slighly in the microwave for 5seconds and theyre perfect. I recieved a sample from influenster for free for testing and review purposes. Thank you.\n",
      "This cookie package was featured at the local supermarket, so I picked up a pack for a road trip I was going on.  I liked the fact the cookie was soft (probably the reason the cookie was individually wrapped), and the taste was almost as good as homemade.<br /><br />Four solid stars for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie.  Just shop on price; if the price is good, you'll enjoy your treat.\n",
      "This was delicious! Add a glass of milk and you have a kids favorite snack! If you love soft cookies these are perfect for you. Wish more came in a box!\n",
      "I got a sample of one of these cookies through influenster.com. After trying the cookie they sent, I went and bought a box of them. The kids love them!! They are a quick and easy snack on the go. They are a bit crumbly, but well worth it to see their smiling faces.\n",
      "I have a picky eater and what completely suprised that he actually liked them! They are so soft and not too sweet! They are heavenly! These will make a great lunchbox treat for your little ones! Highly recommend these!\n",
      "These cookies are super soft and very yummy. The spices make me think of my grandma and her baking cookies! Yum.\n",
      "I love these cookies they are soft and good ! They are great for kids to take as a snack with them I love these !! Great !\n",
      "After trying this cookie I can honestly say it was not all that bad...however, I did notice a vitamin like after taste that at times was a bit over powering. I also didn't like how crumbly it is but your gonna eat it anyway so I can over look that\n",
      "I was presented to try one from my mom voxbox, one word, heaven... It was the first thing I tested.. my 1yr old son even loves em, I already went thru 3boxes\n",
      "Soft and Chewy, my son and I shared a free sample of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from influenster. Very tasty!\n",
      "I received this from Influenster to test and we loved how deliciously soft it was! My son and I enjoyed devouring it!\n",
      "I absolutely loved this cookie. I received this as a free sample but I couldn't just have one so I went out on a search for them and found them at my grocery store. I was so happy because that one big cookie was everything I have been looking for, not too sweet, not too bland, not salty, not too many rasins and most of all not many calories. The perfect snack, especially with a cup of tea and a book...\n",
      "I enjoyed these cookies. They are delicious and not too sweet. The price is very affordable. I received the product to test and went out and bought a box.\n",
      "This cookie taste wonderful.  What's even better is it is good for you too. It does not taste like you are eating oatmeal.  It is a great treat or meal on the run.\n",
      "My daughter loved my free sample of this cookie from influenster. She goobled it right down, which i didn't think she would. She's not the biggest fan of rasins. I tried a bite and thought it was kinda dry myself but if my daughter loves it, i will buy it again! :)\n",
      "my children love these cookies and so do I. They are soo moist and delicuos. These by far are the best tasting oatmeal cookies I have EVER had.\n",
      "Our family is super impressed with these cookies!  They have great flavor, the cinnamon really pops and they stay soft.  They really are about as close to grandma's homemade as I have ever purchased.\n",
      "This cookie was super soft and yummy. It had great flavor.It's a great snack for anyone in the family! I will be buying more of this.\n",
      "To me, the perfect oatmeal cookie would be soft and filled with those soul-comforting warm spices that kind of remind you of Christmas and that is exactly what you get with the Quaker Oats Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie.  Perfect for a mid-morning snack with a cup of coffee.\n",
      "These cookies are amazing!! Taste like a home baked cookie.  They are soft and chewy just like I love my cookies!  I highly recommend them\n",
      "It's a little too dry for my taste.  However, the price and packaging are amazing.  My kid will love these.\n",

      "I got a sample of the Raisin Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster in my Vox Box and it was nice and chewy. I love soft cookies and this was great. I will buy a box next time I go to the store!\n",
      "I love the Quaker Soft Baked Raisin Oatmeal Cookies. They are by far my favorite.  When I don't feel like baking, or it's too hot to do so, I grab these.  They live up to their soft baked claims.  They are also even better heated for a few seconds in the microwave.  Definitely almost as good as homemade.\n",
      "I tried these oatmeal ones and I loved how chewy they were and they weren't bad taste-wise.  I just think that for the price and how few you get in the box, I'd rather make my own.  But if you aren't great at baking, you should definitely buy some!\n",
      "These were amazing! Out of the oven fresh, and full of flavor! Best store bought cookies I have ever tried.\n",
      "These cookies are fantastic! I usually don't like \"Chewy\" cookies because of their textures but i just LOVED these! They tasted amazing! They tasted as if they were just made! Warm them up for a few seconds in the microwave and bam! Yummy \"fresh baked-like\" Cookies!\n",
      "Very soft and chewy. The whole family loved them and I usually don't like raisin cookies but these were very delish!\n",
      "Loved them!<br />I opened the box and got the items out and took a picture. My son saw the cookie and got super excited. I opened the cookie and took a bite then set it down to grab a drink. I came back, and it was gone! My 3 year old had destroyed it! lol.<br />We both agreed it was really good and ran out to buy a box of them. We enjoyed them together that night after dinner with some cookies. Yummy!\n",
      "I received one of these Quaker Soft Baked Cookies in my Influenster Mom Voxbox I was hesitant to eat it as it was 170 calories their are lower calorie alternative snacks out there and cookies but this is as close to homemade as you get i liked that its soft baked and breaks apart easily the overall taste was pretty good as well. Not a purchase for me unless they were to cut about 50 calories from it.\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies were delicious! They were soft and chewy and full of whole oats. My kids gobbled them up and wanted more. I had one with my chamomile tea and the kids enjoyed theirs with milk. I would definitely recommend these cookies for the whole family.\n",
      "These are pretty tasty and filling. If I have no time to eat these hold me over til the next meal.\n",
      "These cookies are excellent and the kids love them too! I recieved them as a sample and went out and bought a box the same day!\n",
      "These cookies are great! They are super soft and chewy with a great texture. My kids LOVED them, and they are moderately healthy.\n",
      "I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie from Influenster.  I thought it was kinda crumbly, but my daughter and I loved it.\n",
      "I got these from influenster to try and they are so soft and yummy. Would recommend these to my friends and family.\n",
      "My 4 year old absolutely loves these. They are always soft and taste super fresh and so easy to find at the grocery store.\n",
      "I dont like how it tastes because i don't like oatmeal or raisins but if you like them then i think its good to eat these cookies because they're healthy and you will probably like the taste.\n",
      "I would definitely recommend getting these cookies.  They taste awesome. Great snack at home or on the go. Really not pricey. Everyone should try them!\n",
      "These cookies taste so good. They are fresh and moist! I like that they are the perfect size and that they are individually wrapped.\n",
      "Not really a cookie lover and specifically not and oatmeal & raisin fan but it was really tasty and fresh!!  Received this as a sample.\n",
      "In our house we LOVE love LOVE cookies! So this cookie was put to the test, and it totally passed with flying colors.  The tase of it was just so delicious and soft. My daughter (5yrs old) loves these too.  So I don't mind giving this to her because it is a healthier cookie.\n",
      "Loved these. Received them in my influenster voxbbox. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Kids love them too. They taste good, they are nice and soft and the packaging leaves them fresh.\n",
      "this is a good cookie very soft and moist I wished they made an oatmeal chocolate chip my kids loved them and I would buy again\n",
      "These are very good, the pack I got was stale, however they still had great flavor to them and are soft & chewy!! They are also a great size and are very filling on their own!! My son has taken them to school for an after school quick bite before sports, and i love to have them at work in case I am starving and know lunch is getting pushed back in the day. They are really great, and if you have tried their oatmeal breakfast bars these are kinda like them, but not as heavy!!\n",
      "Quaker always has high quality products. I like these cookies. They have a great texture and great taste. And they are a good size.  Individually wrapped in foil packets for freshness. Good taste with a nice hint of cinnamon. If you like cinnamon you will love these cookies.\n",
      "These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).<br /><br />Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Fiber!  4g per cookie.<br />- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.<br />- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None really.<br /><br />Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.<br /><br />Recommended.\n",
      "I got these in the momvoxbox from influenster.I am a cookie lover,however these were not my favs.My toddler loved them but he will literally eat almost anything sooooo that doesn't say a whole lot.\n",
      "I am a cookie lover, so I was excited to get to try this product for free through the Amazon Vine program.  Unfortunately, these are just not very good.<br /><br />They are too crumbly, almost powdery, as if maybe they weren't baked enough.  The flavor is okay, but certainly nothing special.  They are soft, but the texture is not pleasant.<br /><br />They remind me of \"Grandma's Cookies\".  Except they are about half as good.\n",
      "These are a very filling and great tasting.  As a quick snack, when you don't have time for a meal, or a super simple quickie breakfast; these are a very good option.  I highly recommend them.\n",
      "My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies.\n",
      "These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something.\n",
      "They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie.\n",
      "One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these.\n",
      "This is a great product. Moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go. This is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day.\n",
      "Tasty cookie!  It was soft, though maybe just a little dry.  The raisins were actually nice and juicy, not all dried up like in most packaged cookies.  Pretty good overall.\n",
      "This cookie is big enough to share! I love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you!\n",
      "I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The Quaker Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.  This will be the ONLY type of soft cookie I will buy from here on out!  I love the quality of Quaker products!\n",
      "These cookies are so good and soft as promised!  Def recommend them to anyone and everyone that is looking for a good cookie at a good price!\n",
      "I love Oatmeal Cookies so I was really looking forward to trying these.  They are so good and soft my favorite combo with a oatmeal cookie.\n",
      "quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies are so good they are soft which is a plus and the taste is great\n",
      "I tried these when given to me to review. I will (and have) get more of these! Delicious! I love the chocolate more than the raisin, but that is purely personal preference on my part.\n",
      "Mommy and kid approved!  I had the opportunity to taste and test Quaker Oatmeal Cookies in Raisin from Influenster and I was happily surprised by the texture, taste, and yumminess.  The kids loved them and didn't even notice the raisins.  I would recommend them for a great healthier snack!\n",
      "The cookie is very soft, chewy, tastes great and good for you. Provides a good sourse of fiber. You fins almost at any store.\n",
      "These are so yummy and I love to eat them! You have to try them they are sooooo yummy! Very great product and worth the money!\n",
      "After trying these for a review for Influenster, I ended up buying a box of these because they were so good! They are soft and they come in individual packages so you can just take on the go. My kids loved these too and since they are a lot healthier then other cookies, I will definitely be purchasing more.\n",
      "I got this is my Mom Vox Box from Influensters to try and my little daughter ate it right up! She thought she wouldn't like it because of the rasins but, she loved it!!! She said it was very soft and yummy! She said it reminds her of grandmas cookies! It tasted like homemade cookies she said! She loved them so much she asked to buy her more every time we go to the store!!! I was very impressed!\n",
      "I will absolutely purchase this item.  I received one of these in my Voxbox, and liked it right away.  The flavor is delicious, and it has a chewy, soft consistency (which I prefer in cookies).\n",
      "I received this product to test as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.com. As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!\n",
      "i receive this at a mom voxbox influenster.com i love this cookie its sooo yummii i will buy more of this cookies\n",
      "I received this product to test as a part of Influenster.com. I really don't like oatmeal cookies, but this was definitely a mind changer. It was so soft. It was mouth watering when I smelled it. I smell all fods before I eat them, especially if I am unfamiliar with them,don't ask why, because I don't know lol. But these were great and it was gone before I finished looking through the box. These are definitel great for healthy snacking and I know kids love them dearly. I can't wait to try the other cookie flavors! Thanks Quaker\n",
      "I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from influenster.com. It was delicious. My only complaint is that is was a little crumbly, a little too messy for kids. Perfect for me however and I was not sharing so it was fine :-)\n",
      "I like the taste and the texture...i personally dont really like this flavor but its actually pretty good :) it passes my picky taste.\n",
      "The first thing I noticed when unwrapping my Quaker cookie was the smell. I smelled fresh baked good as soon as I unwrapped my cookie. I received the oatmeal raisin cookie, I'm not a fan of raisins but I was willing to give the cookie a try just based on the amazing smell. When I took my first bite I was in love, the cookie was soft and moist and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. I totally recommend people try this amazing cookie for themselves.\n",
      "<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from influenster.com.

I was even more surprised by the nutrition facts, a cookie good this good should not be good for you. I will definitely be picking up a box on my next shopping trip.\n",
      "I have been buying these cookies since they first came out and my family loves them. I have bought every flavor they had and there wasn't one that they didn't like. I will continue to buy these for my family. Great price and delicious!!\n",
      "I really enjoyed these cookies. They were soft and yummy. Almost like hommade. I would repurchase them again. Quaker is a brand I love and trust for quality.\n",

      "I absolutely loved these!  They are soft, chewy, and irresistible.  They are not quite like homemade, but darn close.  I had a hard time eating the sample that I got from Influenster.com.  Both of my children asked for one bite and then were begging for more.\n",
      "I received one of these cookies from Influenster and I am always reluctant to try pre-made cookies because they make my teeth hurt. I was pleasantly surprised when my teeth didn't hurt and the cookie made me think of cookies from my childhood. The cookie was fresh and was soft and I am not a huge fan of raisins but honestly I enjoyed them in this cookie. I will be buying a box of these as they are a great snack item for the kids.\n",
      "The kids LOVED this, but I mean, hey it's a large, soft, chewy cookie, of course they are going to love this. Hubby is a little more accustomed to my homemade cooking so he could take it or leave it. I thought there could be a few more raisins in it.<br /><br />Thank you influenster for allowing me to try this product.\n",

      "I never really liked oatmeal cookies but the commercial for the Quaker soft baked Oatmeal cookie bought me. I loved how soft it was and tasted just as fresh as a cookie that just cooled down out of the oven. I am addicted\n",
      "My son doesn't usually enjoy cookies unless they are chocolate chip, or have frosting on them, but when I gave my 2 yr old the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie, he ate it right up! they were delicious!\n",
      "I am a big fan of oatmeal cookies and no one does it better than Quaker..I however was surprised at how soft this cookies are...I was expecting to need to wrap it and put it in the microwave but it was perfect right out of the package.\n",

Once it came out of the box, it was out of the wrapper and I had to split it 3 ways cause the kids saw it and had to have some.  Love the soft, chewy goodness and the flavor is so great and pure.  We are headed out to get some more!<br />*I recieved this product compliments of Influenster however all opinions are my own.\n",

      "I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Quaker and Influenster. I didn't hardly get it out of the box before my 2 year old spied it and had to try it! We split the tasty cookie and both really enjoyed it. I have since bought some of the crunchy Quaker cookies which are really good too, but I really do like the soft, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies for my daughters. It's great afternoon snack and easy to pack in my purse for trips to the zoo or swimming. Also, since there Quaker cookies it's a brand I trust and have used for years so that makes me feel happy about the choice I'm making for my children.\n",
      "I love oatmeal and i love raisins. So the two combined was great!! I loved the Quaker oatmeal and raisin  soft cookie!! I have and will be a future repurchase for myself and my family.\n",
      "As soon as I opened my Mom Vox Box, I pulled out this cookie. I LOVE oatmeal raisin and so does my 2 year old daughter, Lily. She started screaming, \"cookie, cookie mama, cookie\". So naturally I gave in. She liked it. She decided to eat it over her mac and cheese which is unusual for her! I did manage to steal a piece and it is amazingly good! I will definitely be buying these regularly!\n",

They come individually wrapped, which is great for on the go or for little ones. This also makes it easy for me to have just one at a time. They are SUPER YUMMY and  I can't wait to purchase more!\n",
      "At first I wasn't very excited to try the cookie just because I don't normally eat sweets but these were so good! I got the oatmeal one and I loved it. I wanted another when I was fished!\n",
      "I absolutley loved the cookie. It had a great taste and it was chewy good. It was yummy in my tummy.\n",
      "I had the cookie and loved it. My boyfriend and daughter enjoys it as well! It's soft and chewy and would be a great on the go snack since they're individually packaged. How awesome is that! And all at 170 calories per cookie. I personally wouldn't go out and stock up like crazy because I'm more into veggies and fruit snacks but I would buy this again. Quaker always comes out with really great products! =]\n",
      "My 5 yr old son loved the cookies. I enjoyed it as well, I am just used to cookies being a bit sweeter.\n",

      "m, my daughter, my mother, my friends, all loveeeee these.... better than any bakery!! perfect homemade..... cant wait to get a big box of them!\n",
      "I cannot rave enough about these cookies. I received a complementary cookie in my mom Vox box just a few days ago and within the same week bought an entire box to share with my family. These cookies are soft , generously sized and delicious. Definitely a good buy.\n",
      "I am in love with these cookies. They are soft and chewy, and I love how they are individualy wrapped so I don't have to worry with them going stale once I open the box. I definitely would reccomend them to anyone who likes oatmeal cookies or to anyone wanting to try something new.\n",
      "I don't normally like oatmeal cookies, but these cookies are so soft, moist, and melt-in-your mouth delicious that I fell in love. I think it's absolutely brilliant that Quaker Oats has started making oatmeal cookies! They are the experts on oatmeal! I can't wait to see what new flavors they come up with next. So far I've had the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana and they were both very good. I also love the convenient single serve packaging, which is great for my daughter's school lunches.\n",
      "These cookies are very tasty and soft! I received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more!\n",

      "Although not homemade they are as close as you are going to get in a packaged cookie!  They are really soft and full of flavor!  Just big enough to satisfy your sweet tooth too.  My kids really enjoyed these so I will repurchase!\n",
      "When I first opened the package, I felt like a little kid again!  The cookie smelled just like the creamy oatmeal cookies my mom used to make when I was little!  I did not used to get heartburn as a little kid, though, and there was the drawback!  My tummy is just too tender for those crazy oats!\n",
      "I'm glad I got to try this before I actually purchased it.  I would not purchase these.  The initial flavor was ok then it left a kind of chemically after taste.  It kind of reminded me of eating a cookie with the texture of a biscuit.  I definitely needed something to wash it down.\n",
      "The Quaker Oatmeal cookies were absolutely delicious; soft, sweet, and perfect in every way! I will definitely be buying these often! They are very flavorful and just melt in your mouth!\n",
      "I am the type of person who would rather bake something myself because I am so picky about taste and texture.  Let me just say that Quaker NAILED this cookie!  It's awesome!  Somehow it stayed soft and moist, and tasted like it was baked that morning.  Thanks for a quick, easy and healthy snack Quaker!\n",
      "These cookies are so great! They are soft and chewy and taste delicious. I really love homemade cookies right out of the oven, but these taste just as good! Quaker sure makes a great cookie!\n",
      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster to try out and ended up really liking them. I shared the original cookie with my 3yo daughter and husband both of whom enjoyed it also. I actually ended up buying a box the next time we went grocery shopping.<br />The flavor of these is quite nice and the cookies are large and soft. I was impressed with the fact that they're moderately healthy and liked that they weren't too sweet.<br />The cookies are a bit expensive, and I'd prefer to make my own to have more control over the ingredients, but they are a good shopping choice. They're great for short trips or an emergency snack. I'd definitely buy more of them, but not on a weekly basis.\n",
      "Delicious, fresh-baked cookies without the hassle or trouble of making them!  can't wait to  taste more of their different flavors, so yum!\n",
      "cookie was so great nice and chewy the raisans was sweet and moist. everyone should give them a try you will love them. :)\n",
      "QUAKER SOFT BAKED COOKIE IS NOTHN BUT AWESOME GOODNESS! QUAKER SOFT BAKED COOKIE IS DEF A COOKIE IM OK WITH ALLOWING MY CHILDREN TO HAVE ALL DAY EVERY DAY! NEXT ONE TO TRY ..... BANANA NUT?

      "I received one from Influenster and love these cookies because it's soft and chewy without being too sweet. I just wish these were more readily available.\n",
      "I received this Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie in my MOMVOXBOX from Influenster and when i tell you this cookie was soft and chewy and so delicious i dont even like oatmeal raisin cookies so i was very hesitant at first to try it. But after i took that first bite i was in love and i instantly went to the nearest walmart and bought a box of quakeroatmeal raisins cookies. This is a product that is worth a try and you also try the other flavors too and hey i even warm my cookies for a couple seconds in the microwave to get the fresh out the oven warmth going on but like i said try it. This cookie is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I was recently given a package of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I'm already a huge fan of almost all Quaker products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol). They were good sized cookies, individually wrapped to ensure freshness, and had a delicious taste. Now I'm craving them! Overall, they were a great cookie! I'd definitely purchase them again. Can't wait til they're back in stock on Amazon!\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies taste closest to homebaked cookies than any others I have tried. My kids loved them, too. They are moist and flavorful. We like them as a snack, or even as a breakfast on the go!\n",
      "Very very tasty! I received a sample cookie through influenster! This cookie was an amazing guilt free treat! Moist and full of flavor. I had an oatmeal raisin, but there are other flavors. Definitly worth buying. Much healthier than other cookies!\n",
      "This was a great cookie.  I was very happy with how soft it was.  Being in the individual wrapping made it easy to through in the diaper bag or purse.  My 18 month old son loved the cookie.  Would love to have these in the house at all times.  Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies.\n",
      "i love this cookies so does my family bought more this week when we went to the store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack\n",
      "Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says \"soft-baked,\" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 6g (9%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 3.5g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg (5%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)<br />Sugars: 12g<br />Other Carbohydrate: 11g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass.\n",
      "My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with.\n",
      "This is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. My youngest child is 6 and isn't much of a sweets eater. However, he found the sample I received from Influenster and he LOVED it! I have to say, I was a tad disappointed that he didn't save me any but he assured me it was \"yummy\" Will definitely keep these on stock.\n",
      "These cookies are great! They are very soft and have a great flavor. Perfect for taking on the go for the kids.\n",
      "I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. Let me just say that it was so yummy and delicious! After sharing it with my kiddos I was left wanting more. I will definitely be keeping these cookies on hand...the whole family loves them!\n",
      "My kids and I absolutely love these cookies, already on our 2nd box!! I am excited to try all the different flavors, good cookies and they are so tasty!! Yum\n",
      "My daughter and I absolutely love theses oatmeal cookies. Has the right amount of sweetness. Very soft not crunchy like most cookies. Taste like what grandma would bake at home.\n",
      "I received the Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie as part of my Mom voxbox from Influenster.com. It was the first thing I took out of the box because I was hungry. I was honestly expecting not to like it. When I first opened the bag it smelled very fresh. I took a bite of it and instantly loved it. I loved how fresh, soft and chewy the cookie was. I went out and bought more so my husband can also have some, he also loved them. They are a great on the go snack.\n",
      "Good oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />You can pretend you're eating something healthy.  When your marathoner, vegan, 4% body-fat co-worker says, \"Cookies?\" in their smug, disdainful fashion, you can reply, \"No, it's oatmeal\".  Then cram another seven in your mouth, 'cause these are *really* good cookies.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court\n",
      "I love oatmeal cookies!So I decided to try these out.Well I'm a really big fan of these cookies. Their good, tasty, and it's easy to eat when your busy in the morning or you just need a quick snack. You can even heat these up a bit in the microwave or have them cold, it's great either way. But the one complaint I have of these are the raisins, I don't know they just didn't taste that great and they kept getting stuck everywhere my mouth.Glad I tried them though!!\n",
      "These Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious! They are SUPER soft and taste absolutely wonderful. They are made with whole grain which is always a plus and are naturally flavored. My daughter loved them too. We will probably be getting more next time we go grocery shopping!\n",
      "Quick Take:<br />it was a C+<br /><br />Usage Tips:<br />good for kids if they come pre-packaged. kids liked it.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Didn't quite taste home made. too much molasses? too many carbs.<br /><br />love the commercial of the woman biting the neighbors cookie.\n",
      "I got a sample on the Oat Meal Raisin from Influenster.  My kids really loved the taste and we have since bought more.  I think these are great and better than having candy or something else less healthy.\n",
      "I Love these cookies , i have had the oatmeal raisin and the chocolate chip ones and cant wait to try them all mmmmmmmmm good !!\n",
      "These cookies were okay. My 2 & 6 year old sisters loved them but I don't think I'd buy them for myself.\n",
      "Def love these cookies! I let my kids eat it. I don't feel guilty afterwards! Pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to make them extra soft :)\n",
      "I received one of these in my VoxBox to try, it did not make it into the house! It was delicious! Very soft and chewy, flavorful, full of raisins! Absolutely loved it! I can't wait to go shopping so I can get a whole box of these!\n",
      "These cookies were delicious! I love that they were individually packed so I could throw a couple in the diaper bag without having to fuss with pre packing snacks in sandwich bags.  The cookies stayed moist and yummy until snack time.  My kid loves it and so do I.\n",
      "these cookies are super yummy! I love how they can be a quick, tasty and healthier on the go breakfast option.My whole family loves them!\n",
      "I tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie's as a sample through Influenster.  They were so soft and tasted just like homemade.  It is exactly what I expected from Quaker!\n",
      "Three years ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It sucked. There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. With a variety of flavors there's sure to be one for most soft baked style cookie lovers.\n",
      "I received a Soft Baked oatmeal cookie in my VoxBox and was very excited to try it. I am always skeptical about the cookies that are advertised as \"soft\". This one truly is. I tried to save some for my husband but it didn't sit there for long. I wish my oatmeal cookies turned out like this!\n",
      "I absolutely love these cookies! They taste just like homemade Oatmeal Raisin cookies that Grandma would make! They are a good sized cookie too, not the teeny tiny ones like most companies make!\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are so good! They taste like a homemade cookie! If you want that right out of the oven taste try heating up the cookie for about ten seconds. It will be warm and soft!\n",
      "I received a free Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit for me. I love this cookie (but of course I share a little piece with with my husband). I could not put the cookie down, it was so good that I went out and bought a box of the almond with chocolate chips. Can't wait to go and buy more.\n",
      "I saw these when they first came out so I decided to buy a box. Unfortunately I didn't realize they also make a crunchy version and I grabbed that box by accident. While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon.\n",
      "From bbwife31: I received a free Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit in our house. My son devoured almost the whole thing in 2 minutes. The few bites that I got to eat were super delicious and I am not even an oatmeal raisin kind of gal. It was very moist and flavorful. Will buy again in the future!!\n",
      "My son really enjoyed the cookie. He is not a big raisin fan, but the soft oatmeal he liked. I think there was a good amount of raisins in it for the average cookie. I love the single packaging, makes it easy to take a snack on the go.\n",
      "A delicious little snack, can also substitute for breakfast in a hurry! The kids weren't so thrilled but what mom doesn't love a snack that's safe in the pantry?!?!\n",
      "These cookies are soft and delicious. I am very picky about my oatmeal raisin and Quaker delivered! No Trans Fat is a BIG PLUS!\n",
      "this has got to be one of the yummest cookies i have ever had!!!!<br />they are soft and sweet...my kids ate all of them except for the one i had...\n",
      "I recieved these in a gift box and I was exxited to try them. They are soft and chewy great w mik!\n",
      "This cookie is definitely delicious!  I love the homemade taste and the chewy goodness in every bite! I received this cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox so I only got one but I will definitely purchase more oatmeal one's...they are my absolute fav!\n",
      "My husband saw my Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookie and ate it! He said it was delicious...soft and flavorful. Grrrrr...now I have to buy more. I want one!\n",
      "I am pretty picky when it comes to cookies because I like homemade cookies. I tried the Quaker Oatmeal Raisin cookies and I really liked it. It tasted homemade and was soft and chewy. It was a big hit with my 18 month old too!\n",
      "I tried this cookie and LOVED IT!! I have a four year old who is obsessed with anything sweet(but hey who isnt?) an and she absolutely loved this cookie as well. We will definitely be purchasing this again...Thanks to influenster.com for sending us the sample to try out!!\n",
      "I loved the flavor of the Quaker Soft Baked cookies. They are so soft and chewy. And my grandchildren love them so i always keep a box in the house. I will for sure keep buying these cookies.\n",
      "I love oatmeal cookies but not from a package.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are and actually taste home baked!  Good job Quaker!\n",
      "This cookie was absolutely delicious. I received it free in my influenster Mom Voxbox. I only had 1 bite since I shared it with my boys but it that one bite was good enough to tell me it was delicious. It was soft, chewy, satisfying. My kids loved it and wanted more. We have even went and bought some more when we went grocery shopping.\n",
      "I loved the chewyness of the cookie. I was initially worried that it would be cloyingly sweet but the oatmeal gave it a lovely texture without adding too much unnecessary sugar. Will definitely purchase this product. Thanks to Influenster I got to try this product for free!\n",
      "Very soft chewy, and yummy! Heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it tastes even better! Definitely worth trying not hard ,not to chewy and not to sweet just right. Kids love them 2 :)\n",
      "The cookie minus the raisins, which I don't care for, were great. Its rather tasty to have such a high nutritional value. I am interested in trying other flavors.\n",
      "I got a free cookie, from Influenster.com a few weeks ago, and it didn't make it for much longer than 5 minutes.<br /><br />I opened my box, I got my stuff out, I went to get my camera so I could make an \"unpacking\" video, and when I got back, the cookie was gone, and there was a really guilty looking 5 yr old sitting beside the empty wrapper.<br /><br />So I never got to try it. :( But judging from the satisfied look on my daughter's face, she LOVED it!\n",
      "These cookies are great for in the morning when you are in a rush and don't have time to make breakfast they are so tasty! They are even better warmed up. These are also great to keep around for the kids for snack time or to put in there lunch box for school.\n",
      "Very soft chewy, and yummy! Heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it tastes even better! Definitely worth trying and buyin!\n",
      "Delicious. Soft, \"almost\" falls apart soft. Great cinnamon flavor. I allowed myself to only eat half of it at a time so I could savor it.\n",
      "These Cookies are delicious! My kid absolutely loved them. I love that they are individually packed, it makes such an easy grab and go snack ! great product.\n",
      "Mmm! I think that about sums it up. I love how soft these are. I couldn't stop eating them and I'm ashamed to say that I want to buy more. Bye-bye, diet. :(\n",
      "this cookie tastes soo good im really not a fan of raisins but when i tasted this cookie it was like another thing i really recommend it its so good and delicious\n",
      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test from Influenster via the Mom VoxBox. My 3 year old son loved the cookie - each cookie is pretty large, very soft and full of raisins. If you buy a package of 6, they are individually wrapped which is great for travel. It is great that they are made with whole grain Quaker oats - and that they have a nice helping of raisins. They are still a cookie though and have 12 grams of sugar per cookie. I did buy a box for my son for an occasional treat.\n",
      "I recieved one of these to try out in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. I am not a huge raisin fan but I really enjoyed this cookie. So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again. The cookie was super soft, great for my 1 year old to eat. It was also big enough that I could split it between both kids. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a delicious cookie.\n",
      "These were surprisingly tasty. My kids loved them too and they are a great on the go snack. They offer a quick pick me up and aren't too messy in the car when on the go.\n",
      "I got a free bar in my voxbox from influenster and wow!! Soo yummy!! It melts in your mouth and even my 2 year old loved it!\n",
      "Was fortunate enough to receive this in my mommy Voxbox :) I've tried these delicious cookies before, but it was the first time I had shared one with my son. Needless to say, he loved it. I believe it was good because it somewhat melts in your mouth & is really easy to chew (he's 2) .. I will definitely be repurchasing these for us!!\n",
      "I was able to try this yummy cookie when it came in my momvox and i have to say i don't like raisins but when i took my first bite i was very amazed at how good it tasted i would defiantly buy theses for myself as well as my family\n",
      "I got this cookie as a part of my Mom Box from VoxBox. I'm not too keen on oatmeal cookies, but this one was surprisingly good. I guess I'm more used to them being hard so I really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie. Now a chocolate chip one would be fab!\n",
      "These are amazing, soft, and fresh! They taste great and I bought more after I got a free sample from my Mom Vox Box from Influenster~~~ so yummy.\n",
      "Great brand provides a great cookie.  They are soft and have lots of flavor, definitely worth your money.  I received a sample of this from Influenster and am not a fan of raisins, but I agreed to try and review so I gave it a whirl.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  I can't wait to try other kinds!<br /><br />[...]\n",
      "I love love love these yummy snacks. Great for an on the go morning. and the kids love them too!\n",
      "This cookie is so good.  It tasted great.  I ate it faster then I could get it out the box.  I am definately buying more soon!\n",
      "This cookies are amazingly good. I got a free sample in my Mom Vox Box from Influenster and am glad I got to try them out. I'm usually not a fan of oatmeal cookies but these were so soft and moist and had me wanting more. Not only are they good but they're good for you, they're low in fat and high in fiber so they make for a good afternoon snack or evening dessert. I can't wait to go buy more at the store!\n",
      "I can't wait to pick up some more of these! I love soft, chewy cookies and these definitely hit the spot.\n",
      "I love this product, it was delicious and my daughter enjoyed it as well, i cant wait to get my hands on more !\n",
      "Quaker is a trusted brand that has always had great products and this in no different. The cookies are soft , chewy and very fresh. I love that the cookies are individually wrapped for easy snacks or lunches. Its a treat that I feel good giving my family. Will be buying in the future!\n",
      "I received this cookie in my mom voxbox. This cookie was soft and delicious! My kids usually only eat cookies with chocolate chips or M&M's in them, but surprisingly enough, they snatched it from my hands and gobbled it up! I love that it is only 170 calories per cookie, 4 grams of fiber, and 8% iron, making it a good snack. I only wish it had less sugar.\n",
      "I tried the best cookie ever from Quakers! I never tasted a soft, fresh cookie like Quakers Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. I was one of the lucky ones to receive a Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012 (complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster). The Voxbox comes with several items and one of the items was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie. It tasted like a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie. The raisins, the oats and you could even taste the cinnamon that's in the cookie. It was so delicious, even my kids loved it! I have 4 kids: 2 year old, 3 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and they all enjoyed a piece of the cookie. The little ones even started crying when it was all done. So that definitely means I have to go out and buy some more.\n",
      "This is going to be the fastest review you have ever read because this is a great cookie.<br /><br />Thoughts: This is a really ez and fast way for you and your kids to snack on the go, a great way to get your fiber, and its for you.<br /><br /> The Run Down: If you are a fan of oatmeal cookies then you'll love these. They are soft and chewy like the name says.<br /><br />The Final Say: I have bought them for my family and my little one loves them. We talk them every where. They are about 3$ for a box of 6. All in all i give these 5 (*****). Ill keep buying them for the family. So go get some for yourself!!\n",
      "These cookies are moist just like homemade cookies!!! By far the best store bought cookie and is a must have in any moms pantry!!\n",
      "I received the oatmeal raisin cookie in my momvoxbox from influenster and it was pleasantly surprised by how chewy and tasty the cookie was considering that oatmeal raisin cookies are usually hard.  I'm not a big fan of the oatmeal raisin cookies but my little brother loved it and i'll most likely purchase the chocolate chip cookies because their a healthier alternative to most i think :)\n",
      "I love oatmeal cookies, but sometimes they tend to be too hard or too dry! Not these!! These are soft and great to give to my toddler when he wants something sweet. I don't like to give him snacks with too much sugar and these are perfect.\n",
      "This is not at all what I was expecting, but better! The cookie was so moist and just delicious! Im not a huge fan of raisins, but in all honestly you could not even tell the cookie had raisins, you couldnt even taste them. Absolutley worth the buy, will be purchasing in the future!!\n",
      "I Tried this product in my mom vox box and it was delicious and soft. My i pinched my children a piece off and they loved it too! We will be buying these more often.\n",
      "These cookies are Quaker baked, mom and kid approved. They are soft, chewy, and most of all delicious. The texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking.\n",
      "Great taste and healthy what more could you ask for. Most cookies of this type are dry and make you think you are eating paper but not with Quaker they are soft and moist!\n",
      "These are so good and soft and chewy! The taste is delicious. I tried the Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were delicious. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "This cookie was actually really yummy.  I'm not usually the type of person to like raisins in my cookies, but these were really good and moist. I will definitely be buying these in the future. :)\n",
      "I got to sample this for free. These were soft and delicious. I actually left this partially eaten on the counter overnight and it was still soft the next day when I finished it. Which is good because my kids only half finish what they start eating. I thought it was a great tasting oatmeal cookie - just better without the raisins. I'm not big on them but I was able to pick them out. They need these just in oatmeal with no other ingredient - like raisins added.\n",
      "I received this item in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie was very soft and flavorful. Usually you get cookies like this and they are either hard or dry, and that was not the case with Quaker Brand. I'm not a big fan of raisins but they were fine in this cookie. Just the right amount and not over powering.<br /><br />This is one cookie I would purchase on my own, and I'm sure my son will be very happy about it.\n",
      "I received this item for free from Influenster in my mom Vox Box. I am not usually a fan of raisins, but this cookie was soft and tasted just like it was freshly baked. I absolutely loved it.\n",
      "These cookies are so yummy..<br />They are so soft & don't get stale. I would definitely repurchase these.. I want to try other flavors!\n",
      "I received a sample of your soft baked oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.  Within seconds of opening the box my kids were fighting over who would get it!  We all got a taste and it was delicious!  I really liked the flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely buy your product again in my local grocery or on amazon.\n",
      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br />As soon as I opened up the box, the cookie was on top. My 5 year old couldn't wait to get her hands on it.<br />She enjoyed every single morsel. And wanted more. So on my next food shopping day, I will definitely be picking up a box. GREAT JOB QUAKER!\n",
      "I received the Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box and I saw the cookie sitting right on top, so of course I opened it and tried it out! This cookie was so soft and chewy that I am totally buying more as snacks for my little cookie monster!\n",
      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br /><br />I opened the box, saw the cookie and ate it right away. I was going to save half for my nephew to try but it was so good I ended up eating both halves any way. Nice and soft and chewy and sooooo yummy. TOTALLY buying more\n",
      "This cookie barely last five minutes in my hands. It was soft & chewy and great on-the-go snack. Its perfect for kids and adults.\n",
      "I had the opportunity to try a Quaker Soft Baked  Oatmeal Cookie through Mom VoxBox, and whew was I pleased! I took my sample into work and had it for a snack one night. Soft and with just the right amount of cinnamon in their oatmeal cookie!\n",
      "Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot. I took one bit of this thinking I'd be giving the rest of it to my 2 year old daughter. It was DELICIOUS!!! Needless to say, she didn't get any of the cookie. :o) Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying this again!!\n",
      "I am a huge fan of soft cookies so this is top of the line!  I love how soft and flavorful they are.  since they are individually wrapped, it keeps them soft and fresh!\n",
      "I put this is my dad's lunch because he always wants something sweet but I want him to eat healthy. I'm a health-nut & the ingredients in this cookie didn't scare me away. My dad said it tasted home-made (in a good way) & seemed really fresh. The portion size was also good.\n",
      "I didn't even get a chance to eat this because my 3 sons STOLE it from me.  They LOVED IT!!! I will absolutely buy these again!!!\n",
      "Im not the biggest fan of oatmeal but I really liked this cookie so much that I went and bought a couple boxes!\n",
      "I really liked them they was the best box of cookies I gotten so far I will be getting them again real soon\n",
      "I received a sample of the Quaker Oatmeal cookie in my Influenster voxbox. I'm not a fan of raisins so I let my daughter try it. She loved it. She said she enjoyed the raisins and liked the soft cookie instead of a regular crunchy one.\n",
      "The Quaker Cookie, was a great soft cookie to eat. My 3 years old daughter really enjoyed the treat! It was soft, there wasn't any after taste to the cookie.. Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the Quaker Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)\n",
      "I received a sample of this product from Influenster. My daughter and I split it and it was delicious. I'm going to have to check Kroger to see if they have them, because my Walmart did not.  :(\n",
      "When Influenster and Quaker sent me this cookie to try, it looked delicious--but healthy-so you never know!  But, I was delighted because it is good for you and Great Tasting!  Love it!\n",
      "These cookies are great! So yummy! My little boy loved these cookies! Since they are in individual packages, they are great for purses and diaper bags!\n",
      "Quaker has yet to disappoint.  I am not a big fan of raisins, but these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are the best!  Very chewy and fresh, great for on the go or kids lunches!\n",
      "I thought the cookie was good. It was soft and chewy; however I prefer organic foods and would much  rather have a freshly baked cookie!\n",
      "These cookies were so very scrumptious. They taste homemade and I won't lie... I gobbled it down in mere seconds. I will be purchasing many more.\n",
      "Wow, a soft moist & delicious cookie~Quaker has done it again.  Great snack for on the go or to enjoy at home with a nice glass of cold milk.<br /><br /> This cookie is large enough to share with two if you have little ones.  The added bonus is its nutritional value!  Grab a box and enjoy!\n",
      "These are great especially for little hands.  I love how soft Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are.  My son really can't get enough of these things!\n",
      "Love the cookies!  I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was.  I am not usually a soft cookie fan but this one was an exception.  Also, this is a pretty healthy choice if you are craving sweets.\n",
      "This cookie was great. It was a little soft, but that's what made it even better. It didn't take long for it to vanish, which might be a bad thing if you lack self control (something I do not possess). I recommend these to everyone unless you are allergic to raisins.\n",
      "This cookie is so soft and taste amazing! I was so surprised with how moist and chewy it was, better than home made, believe it or not. My whole family were begging for more, highly recommend trying this!\n",
      "I received this cookie in my Influenster voxbox and LOVED it! It tasted just like what I would make at home. Delicious!\n",
      "I received this product thru Influenster and Quaker in my MomVox box. I opened it jn front of my 8 year old which he took off running with it and later came back and told me that he needs it for his snack at summer camp. We went out and bought a box and he takes one every morning for camp. Love it!!!\n",
      "I have tried this from Influenster and its delish! I also purchased more of this because it became my son's favorite snack! Love it too! :)\n",
      "I received this cookie from Influenster and Quaker in my Mom VoxBox. I was so excited to get the chance to try this cookie. Then it came and my youngest took it before I got the chance! I was so disappointed but from what I understand from him it is one of the best cookies he has ever had, and it tastes better than the cookies I bake him at home.\n",
      "The Quaker Oatmeal cookies are deliciously soft, the cookies are individually wrapped, and I like that because you can take one package on the go and have a good snack a healthy one. I like this Raisins cookies a lot.\n",
      "Quaker Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)\n",
      "No-one should do oatmeal better than Quaker ....right? Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.\n",
      "These cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. Very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!\n",
      "I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality\n",
      "Maybe it was the hot weather? Maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br />These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.<br /><br />Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.<br /><br />Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced.\n",
      "These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products.\n",
      "I really liked these cookies. They are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. They worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).  They aren't coated in sugar the way a lot of prepackaged oatmeal cookies are.  Each cookie is individually packaged and is easy to open on the go.<br /><br />I'd totally buy these the next time I see them in the store.\n",
      "Quaker is pretty much the oatmeal company, and they have done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie. I liked the convenience of being individually wrapped, which also preserves its freshness. I take one of these along during a round of golf and in my lunch. The cookie is tasty, light and moist. I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin.\n",
      "These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.  The taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too \"processed,\" not like simple and fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.  I would not recommend them personally, although my little ones liked them fine (although I rarely know kids to say \"no\" to a cookie!).\n",
      "I got to this in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I don't like oatmeal cookies. So I had my daughter try it and she LOVED it. She said \"Mom, this cookie is really good. Is there another one. I only got one.\" I told her no that, that was all. She was really bummed. But I told her that when we go to the store and if we see them we'll make sure to buy them since she likes them so much.\n",
      "Cookies are delicious and very soft, i expected a much different taste but to my surpise they were actually great. I got a sample so i will be purchasing these for my family soon.\n",
      "I was given a chance to sample this cookie when I got my Mom vox box from Influenster and Quaker, much thanks. The kids and I shared the cookie it was soft and chewy really good we will be buying them again.\n",
      "I was really excited to get this Quaker Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft.\n",
      "I recently tried them and they are chewy goodness!  Be sure to try them heat them up, oh your going to love them/\n",
      "I just wanna say that we are completely hooked on this cookie now! My kids love the product as well! Especially with all the nutritious qualities of the cookie and the great taste! We are def sticking with this from now on!!\n",
      "Love at first bite! Very moist and delicious! Definitely recommend to everyone who is a fan of Oatmeal Raisin cookies.\n",
      "I recently tried this product through my influenster mom vox that I received and I have to admit that I am not a big fan of cookies HOWEVER this has to be the best cookie I've ever tasted thus far so much that I ate the whole thing before I could even record my youtube video, lol.\n",
      "This is the best prepackaged cookie I've ever had! They have great flavor, are soft and chewy, and just everything you would expect in a homemade cookie! I was given it in an Influenster voxbox and I can say that I will be purchasing these very often!\n",
      "i actually tried this cookie through influenster is was really chewy which is how i like my cookies i dont like them hard and crunchy its very good but the after taste left in you mouth is kinda nasty but overall one good cookie\n",
      "i received this product from influenster to test!!.. i loved it it was so soft and delicious i would have not bought this if i went to the store because it is \"healthy\".. but after tasting it i will definitely be buying more!!\n",
      "I recently tried this cookie as part of an Influenster Mom Vox Box.  Influenster sends out free boxes of products in order for you to test them and give them your feedback. I really enjoyed this cookie!  Most packaged cookies are hard and taste like cardboard but I was pleasantly surprised that this cookie was soft and comparable to a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie.  The nutritional facts weren't too bad for a dessert too.  It was very yummy and filling.  A good sized cookie!  I will definitely be buying some for my family, since I ate this one myself ;)\n",
      "I received a free cookie from Influenster, and it made my week. I normally avoid packaged cookies because I like the chewy freshness of homemade so much better. These had an amazing flavor of cinnamon and spice, and the texture was perfect. I need to go get my own box!\n",
      "I was given a sample of these Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster.com as part of their Mom VoxBox 2012 for reviewing. I shared my cookie with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. As with any cookie, she loved it! I thought the cookie was delicious. Not overly sweet, but had perfect flavor. It was moist too, unlike some cookies that are dry. My least favorite part was how crumbly it was. It did have a tendancy to crumble quite a bit. Overall, it was a great cookie.\n",
      "I received this delicious treat complimentary of Influenster in my Mom voxbox. I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)\n",
      "I got the opportunity to taste test these awesome cookies from Influenster and Quaker in their Mom VoxBox and found the cookie to be absolutely delicious! It was soft and chewy, just how I like my cookies! My four year old and I shared it and half was enough for each of us and he loved it too!\n",

      "I received the Oatmeal cookie complementary in my Influenster Mom Voxbox and I couldn't be more impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the taste! I will definitely be buying more, especially now that I know they come in these amazing flavors!! Yummy! They are great to have on the go and especially delicious warmed up with some milk!!  And they are not too expensive on the calorie bank either!\n",
      "I tried these cookies as a sample from influnster.com. They are a little sweet for my taste, the kids loved it. They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!\n",
      "I received a cookie as part of an Influenster review. I love that it tastes like a fresh cookie from Grandma's oven. I knew I would love it, but was uber pleased to see that my 2 year old loves it as well. This is definitely something that will replace a fruit snack!\n",
      "I received a complimentary Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster.com for review purposes. This cookie is huge and hearty! This is literally the first Oatmeal Cookie I have ever been able to get my picky teenage son to eat! Very soft! Just like homemade! Quaker has really outdone themselves!\n",
      "I received this item from Influenster and loved them so much thaton my next grocery trip I purchased three boxed.  I received the oatmeal raisin from Influenster and I also purchased the banana nut and the chocolate almond.  The raisin was my favorite soft and moist, loved them\n",
      "These cookies are amazing! They are moist, flavorful and are really satisfying. I can't wait to add them to my teenagers lunches in the fall!\n",
      "I was really surprised at how good these are! Very soft and chewy, however maybe a little too soft. I recently packed them in a lunch and got complaint that they crumbled\n",
      "These were very tasty, my three year old son even gobbled them up! They are very soft, and as long as you like oatmeal cookies you will love these!\n",
      "Yumm yumm yumm we loved them like that way they are soft for the kids and they taste so good\n",
      "Bought these for my husband and he really likes them! I haven't tried them yet, but I'm going to give them a shot.\n",
      "For an Oatmeal Raisin cookie this isn't bad at all. Nice and soft, great taste. I like the other flavors of this cookie as well.\n",
      "I got a sample of these yummy thangs in my Influenster Mom VoxBox and they are delicious! I shared mine with my toddler and she also loved it, cried when we ran out of cookie! They are nice and soft and really tasty! Go on and get you some, girl!\n",
      "I love Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They taste so good! They are moist, soft, and just the right size! The first cookie i had i received in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.com. It was so good that the next day I went out and got a whole box! They are great for on the go snacks. I keep one in my purse for when I need a little snack! <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a>\n",
      "I also received a sample of this cookie from Influenster.  My daughter really enjoyed it. I think it is a little high in sugar to make it a regular treat but I would repurchase it in the future.\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:<br /><br />-Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving<br /><br />Definite buy, if on sale stock up.\n",
      "I recieve sample of this cookie from Influenster to try out. I normally dislike cookie with raisins but this one was good. I will not get these again but thats not because it wasn't a good cookie its because of the raisins. I will how ever try these in other flavors.\n",
      "I love these cookies. They have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. The opinion expressed herein are my own personal opinion and have not been influenced by Influenster or any other third party.\n",
      "I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there.\n",
      "I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were much more moist then other brands. Also I like the fact that it's made with whole grain quaker oats and it provides a good source of fiber. These are a great thing for kids to eat!! [...]\n",
      "I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.  I have been a big fan of oatmeal cookies all my life and I put this right on top.  What really impressed me was the sofeness and the taste was just awesome.  If I didn't know better, I'd think they came right out the oven. Lets not forget the wholesome ingredients it contain.  You couldn't ask for a better cookie.  If I didn't know better, I think my mom made these.\n",
      "I received a cookie from Influenster. I am not a big fan of oatmeal and raisin cookies,not since my Granny spoiled my taste buds. Ever since then I have tried to find cookies on the market that were comparable to hers, with no luck. I was surprised by this cookie! It tastes so close to the homemade ones that my Granny used to make!! The size is enormous and the raisins are soft and chewy. Definitely worth buying! LOVE IT!\n",
      "I really dislike oatmeal cookies and raisins..I got a cookie from influenster and this cookie was awesome and made me change my mind about oatmeal raisin cookies. I would def. get these again.\n",
      "I am not a big fan of raisin cookies, But I had a taste of their raisin oatmeal cookies & they were delicious ! I am surprised my son loved them too.

      "First let me say that I tried this product because I received it in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster as a complementary test product.  That said, these cookies are off the hook delicious.  They really do taste just like homemade (I know, because I make my own all the time).<br /><br />I only ate a bite because my son was chomping at the bit to have it and as soon as his little hands got ahold of this cookie, it was gone in seconds and he was asking for more.  We'll certainly be buying a box to keep for when it's just too hot to turn on the oven and make our own!\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were truly much more moist then other brands.  They had a good oatmeal flavor and were packed with raisins, but were not as sweet as I expected.  After a few bites, I found just a little bit of the cookie was the perfect amount to fill me up and calm my sweet tooth.<br /><br />*I received a free sample of this product from VoxBox in order to provide an honest and accurate review.\n",
      "I was Fortunate enough to be sent this item through influenster. I really enjoyed the cookie. It was delicious soft goodness that didn't make me feel as guilty as eating an Oreo<br />Thank you Quaker!\n",

      "These are some of the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever - I usually bake my own cookies but to be honest I'm not sure I can do better than these!  They are soft, melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor.\n",
      "This product was great! My kids love them and they are a healthier option when you are on the go!\n",
      "Just after getting this cookie I ate it right up! I love my cookies soft and oatmeal cookies aren't normally the most moist cookie. These had such a great flavor even better than my own homemade ones. My family was not happy that I ate the whole cookie without sharing!\n",
      "These cookies are delicious!!!!!!! my 4 year old loved them i barely got any. great for snacks and on the go.\n",

She's not a big breakfast eater, but she enjoyed this cookie. The raisins were nice and plump, not dried out and hard. Very impressed with the size of it too. This is a great cookie.\n",
      "These are perfect for on the go...we are often rushing out the door and I often grab something as the door is closing.  These are perfect to fill you up and give you the start to the day that you need.

      "I was lucky enough to try this cookie in a Mom VoxBox from Infuenster. So glad they gave me a sample because I would have never tried it on my own since I don't really like oatmeal raisin cookies. This cookie was delicious, not too sweet, very soft and chewy and my 17month old daughter also loved it. These cookies will be found in my house from now on.\n",

      "They are amazing. So good and soft chewy. I so recommend them.my kids evwn enjoyed them. I will be purchasing these\n",
      "These were pretty great. We got the Oatmeal Raisin but to me they tasted like Pumpkin Pie which was even better. My husband and three year old liked them as well. Especially the three year old. These cookies were pretty great. Very dense so one is definitely enough. I want to try another flavor next time too! Maybe something with chocolate!\n",
      "I recently received a sample of this cookie, and I enjoyed it!  The cookie was soft and not too dry.  It was a little spicier than I generally like my oatmeal cookies, but it definitely had some flavor. I wouldn't say that it's my favorite oatmeal cookie ever, but I would be very okay with eating more of them  :)\n",
      "This individually wrapped cookie was moist, soft and chewy. The taste was perfect and it was beyond expectations, the perfect bite.\n",

      "We recently got one of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies to try ViA Influenster and Quaker. And my family loved them! They don't taste store bought at all. They tasted home made!! Very soft and moist!\n",
      "Upon recieving this cookie in my voxbox from influenster I sceptical because you expect cookies in a package to be very dry and more often than not tasteless, the cookie recieved in the package was surprisingly moist and very flavorful, it tasted very good and I will definately purchase them in the future.\n",
      "My daughter and I tried the soft baked oatmeal cookies and we both agreed it's delicious!  I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.  The oatmeal doesn't overpower the raisins and the raisins don't overpower the oatmeal, it's a perfect balance.  The raisin were soft, not hard like other brands we've tried in the past.  The price for the quality is well worth it.\n",
      "I absolutely fell in love with these cookies.  I love my cookies soft and not hard, unless it's an Oreo and then I soften it in milk, but these cookies are hands down the closest I've had to homemade!\n",
      "Less calories than a candy bar! I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available.\n",
      "Got a free sample cookie from @influenster's Mom voxbox. These cookies are great they are soft and chewy and left me wanting more!\n",
      "I was given a sample of the Quaker Chewy oatmeal cookie from Influenster. I enjoyed the taste and texture of my cookie. I will buy them again if they are on sale or I have a coupon to use.\n",
      "There is one thing that I love, I love eating something absolutely delicious and knowing that what I am eating is actually healthy and jampacked full of nutrients!!! I received a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and it was delicious, and you know what else? My little sweet toothed diva, loved it too, I know this because she took it from me and made it disappear like magic! You want a healthy treat that you kids will love and enjoy too, this is a definite must try.\n",
      "Greta cookies and amazing nutrition in them. Would definitely purchase this product. ,y favorite part was the delicious oatmeal put in them.\n",
      "These are very good. Nice and soft. Would for sure get again. Since they are packaged individually its nice for travel. A great snack.\n",

      "We received these to try and they were fantastic my husband loves oatmeal raisin and he couldn't get enough! I think the verdict is that they're fantastic and we'll definitely be buying more!\n",
      "liked the flavor just wished it had more oatmeal in the cookie. But i do like how soft it was!!\n",
      "I loved the softness of this cookie but not to keen on oatmeal but I will be buying more of these just not in that flavor. my kids loved the cookie!\n",
      "I've always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son.  he loves soft cookies, so I was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives.\n",
      "The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me).\n",
      "Nice flavor, and only 70 calories per cookie; the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying.\n",
      "These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an \"oatmeal\" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies.\n",
      "These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices.\n",
      "These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either.\n",
      "These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced \"soft\" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don't expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I've had worse (Chips Ahoy \"chewy gooey\" for instance).\n",
      "These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are \"soft-baked\", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don't taste that good.<br /><br />I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter.\n",
      "I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative.\n",
      "For a product like this, it's pretty good. Soft, tasty, seemed fresh. They didn't last long at my house. I thought they were a bit too sweet, but the kids loved them. I'd rather eat home-made, but this is the next best thing.\n",
      "Quaker cookies have always been one of my favorites and these do not disapoint. These cookies are so delicious! They are soft and chewy and scrumptious. My kids love them, I love them, this is definitely on my shopping list :)\n",
      "I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try the quaker cookie.  It was soft and amazingly delicious.  My daughter loved it as well.  Will definatly be purchasing these in the future.\n",
      "I received this Oatmeal raisin cookie from influenster and they were so delicious! They were soft and moist and I will definitely get these in the future for my family!\n",
      "I received a sample of this cookie and oh my goodness it didn't let me down.  It was delicious and tastes a lot like a homemade cookie you'd make yourself!

      "I received this cookie from Influenster to try and review. Mine was raisin flavored and It was yummy! I would recommend this cookie based on price , easiness to find and purchase, and flavor/ softness! As close to homemade as you can get without the work! And reasonably healthy as well! yummy!\n",
      "I loved the Quaker Soft Baked oatmeal cookie that I got to test recently! The spices in the cookie were perfect, and the flavor was better than homemade! I'm not an Oatmeal raisin cookie eater, but this was a soft and Delish cookie that I truly enjoyed!\n",
      "I recieved this cookie sample  complimentary for testing and review from Influenster.<br /><br />I let my neighborhood kids test this out. (see pictures below) .  It was easy for them to open and they loved the cookie itself.  They asked me to go buy them some for snacks.  Here is the information about the cookie\n",
      "This was one of the best soft cookies I've had in a while that was store brought. I am not a big fan of raisins but this cookie made me forget all about them. If you are thinking about buying these, they are a good buy. A Great snack for Adults and children.\n",
      "I was desperate for something to eat but had to rush rush rush out of the house for a family emergency.  I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I grabbed one of these cookies and headed out the door.  As I drove to pick my son up from school, I ate the cookie and was surprised at how satisfied I was.  No more growling or stomach pains.  And the fullness lasted until dinner!\n",
      "These quaker cookies are so great, they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run.\n",
      "I received a sample of the Quaker oatmeal raisin soft baked cookies (courtesy of Influenster.com) about a month ago and since then I haven't purchased any other oatmeal cookie. I love them and most important my daughter loves them. These make the perfect snack for lunch, at day at the park or beach, or a midnight snack. Best part is they are healthy and don't make you feel bad for \"cheating\" a little on your diet. There's so much to say but to sum it all up....they are DELICIOUS!!!\n",
      "I loved it is was so yummy.  I had to go out and buy a box write after I got my free sample thru influenster.com.  My kids loved it too they dont last in my house of how yummy thye are!!!!\n",
      "Anyone looking for quick, delicious, healthy snack should definitely put these on their shopping list. They come individually wrapped which makes them perfect for taking along with you when running around and they're very filling with the whole grains and rolled oats.\n",
      "I received one of these cookies as a sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox. I didn't think I'd like it because I'm not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies. The plan was to give it to my husband who loves them. Well, before he could get it, my daughter snatched it up. She doesn't like raisins but loved this cookie! I talked her into giving me a bite and it was really good! It was really soft, not dry. I have been trying to find them in the store to buy some more but so far haven't had any luck.\n",
      "I received a sample of these in my summer mom voxbox from influenster and as soon as we opened it everyone wanted a piece and we had to share! One cookie just wasn't enough...I'll have to buy more..they were so soft and tasted like it was freshly baked..not overly sweet and the raisins were plump and soft...highly recommend!\n",
      "Wow I wasn't expecting to like these as much as I didi but they were great. Even my pickiest of eaters my daughters ate them for breakfast and now my hubby likes to snack on them at work.\n",
      "As a mom of 2 teens one being a diabetic I am always looking for healthy low carb snack...I found it YUMMMMY these really are great and then next best thing to homemade!!\n",
      "I recieved this cookie in my Influenster Momvoxbox. We recieved the Oatmeal Raisin cookie. It was so soft and tasted sooo good. There was only one so my kids and I had to share. Later that afternoon I went out and bought the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana Nut. Love them!\n",
      "Let me just say wow!  I was a little apprehensive at first because prepackaged cookies are never as soft and chewy as advertised but these Quakers cookies were amazing they were soft, chewy and tasted like they were baked fresh.  I will be recommending these to everyone i know\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins Cookie was so good. It tasted homemade. It was big and filling. They are prefect for lunched for the kids too. I cant wait to try other flavors.\n",
      "I loved this cookie! It was soft and very good! It didnt taste like all those other prepackaged cookies with that chemical aftertaste. I bought a box yesterday!\n",
      "I love these cookies! Delicious, chewy, moist, just good overall. I have always been a Quaker fan. I love all of their products.\n",
      "My favorite cookie is Oatmeal Raisin and these cookies are the bomb! They are so moist and chewy. Perfect with a cup of tea, snack after lunch, or just anytime. I love them.\n",
      "We thought this cookie tasted really good! My husband and kids really liked them.I love the different types. We will certainly buy again.\n",
      "Its aq big cookie & it doesnt taste like its added full of fillers. It actually tastes pretty homemade to me\n",

      "This was the best soft baked cookie i ever had. Highly suggest you give this cookie a try if you havent already.\n",
      "I hope they make chocolate chip next!! These cookies are wonderful!! Fresh, taste homemade better than any other store bought cookie!\n",
      "I was worried that these were going to be dry and not as \"soft\" as some cookies claim to be, but these were amazing. there was a great cinnamon taste that reminded me of fresh baked cookies, and I honestly was not expecting them to be so good! I have forced many of my friends and family to try them, and they love them as well!!!<br />if you love oatmeal raisin cookies..you will LOVE these!\n",
      "My daughter ate this cookie and loved it.  She stated that it was soft and moist and not too sweet.  My baby also liked this cookie, his review was a little more understated though.  He cooed and smiled and tried to steal more from his sister.  I will definitely be purchasing this product in my normal grocery-shopping routine. I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. @Quaker #quakersoftbaked @influenster\n",
      "I really liked the cookies. My daughter loves the as well as a special to treat to share with me. A little crumbly but that what you get for a real soft and moist cookie and not one chocked full of chemicals to keep cookies fake,y moist and chewy.\n",
      "I Love these cookies.  They smell and taste delicious.  The balance is of sweetness is perfect. If you love oatmeal you would love this cookie. I recommend it.\n",
      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:21 Mins<br /><br /></span>I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. The cookie is DELICIOUS according to my Grandson Elijah (see video). I am dieting so I couldn't eat it but he LOVED it! It's chewy and filled with raisins. I will definitely buy this for him in the future!<br /><br />@influenster<br />@quaker<br />hashtag: #quakersoftbaked<br />Quaker Facebook Page: [...]\n",
      "@influenster @quaker my kids fight over them; homemade taste is great; always a trustworthy company.  Been buying 2 boxes a week since we first sampled them!\n",
      "Quaker soft baked cookies are delicious. I love the consistency, texture, taste, and quality of ingredients. It is a quick, easy, healthy snack for on the go or at home. The raisins are good size and very juicy. This is probably the best soft oatmeal cookie I have had in a very long time. Definitely would buy again.\n",
      "Almost taste freshly baked and homemade. And the size of one cookie didn't leave me wanting more, it was a perfect little treat. I would try the chocolate almond one next time.\n",
      "I thought they would be dry like most Oatmeal Cookies you can buy! Not the case with these delicious beauties! My kids can't get enough of them :) They are on my shopping list for good!\n",
      "Ive tired this before but got one with the Influenster VoxBox 2012 this month YUMMy- they can be alittle dry though.\n",

      "If you like soft, chewy cookies with lots of raisins, this is the cookie for you. My husband and kids love them and I love them because I'm not asked to bake so often with them in the house.\n",
      "I don't care for oatmeal cookies + I was actually going to give this to my husband. I kind of feel guilty that I didn't lol. But it was really soft + yummy. Making me reconsider only keeping stock in chocolate chip cookies.\n",
      "This was so soft and yummy! My kids absolutely loved it and its perfect to throw in your bag or lunch box for on the go treat.\n",
      "I gave this product 4 stars because of it's usefulness to me. The kids LOVED it and they're not huge fans of oatmeal cookies! I thought it was tasty; however, I'm not likely to purchase it with frequency because I try to avoid packaged foods, and do not store a lot of sweets in the house for the kids. I would however choose this over the competition. (I got this product as a free trial from influenster.com)\n",
      "i love this cookie it was so soft and chewy and oh so yummy!!! not a fan of raisins but the cookie was goood and my husband loved it\n",

      "I received a quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie from Influenster to try and review. I shared this with my son who does not like oatmeal and he loved it! I love that it is made with whole grains and could be a good substitute for an on the go breakfast when I am running behind. The flavoe is very good, I love the soft texture, I really don't care for hard cookies and this one is perfect. I would recomeend this product to others and will probably purchase some more for my family.\n",
      "These are the most amazing cookie EVER!  I had mine a bit warm from the sun and it was like rite out of the over goodness!  Heaven in a baggie!\n",
      "These are perfect for a quick breakfast on the go or as a snack.  My little man loved it!  I would love to see a just oatmeal one without raisins.  We are definitely getting these again.\n",
      "I have really never liked oatmeal cookies until I tryed this one. And all I got to say it was great! Great taste and wasnt over cooked just right.\n",
      "This was the most delicious cookie i have tasted. I thought it was going to taste like all the other store bought cookies. It was moist, chewy,and very delicious! I would definitely buy this product again.\n",
      "So, I got a sample of this product in the mail.Just opened the box and the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, was gone. My son eat almost all and i just try a little bit. When he finished all star to cry and i have to buy some more at the store. now this is a family favorite to eat with milk. Its so soft like cake, i love it, and so healthly to my kids. Try one, you dont regret it!\n",
      "So, I got a sample of this product in the mail. After a few hours I thought well maybe I'll try it and it just happened to be the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, but the cookie was gone. My daughter just happened to \"go missing\" around the same time, and she's a mommy's girl and never leaves my side. So as I'm searching for her, I find her in my bathroom shower with the cookie almost ate up. I would have gave it to her anyway if she asked, but she hit it from me and ate it all herself! My daughter is extremely finicky when it comes to snacks, but this she gobbled right up. A cookie you can't go wrong with and good for them too!\n",
      "I received a free sample of these cookies in my Mom Voxbox thanks to Influenster and Quaker and was very impressed! The cookie is very soft, chewy and tastes great! Microwaving the cookie for a few seconds makes it even better.\n",
      "I dont usually eat oatmeal cookies but these were very soft and delicious,my kids even liked them and they are very picky\n",
      "I received a sample of this cookie from Influenster as part of their Mom Voxbox and man, was it good!  I was expecting a mediocre cookie and was pleasantly surprised.  It was melt-in-your mouth soft and so, so tasty!  I will definitely be picking up a box of these at the store.\n",
      "thanks to influenster i was able to try this product through the mom voxbox. i was pleasantly surprised at the taste but being a baker i prefer my homemade cookies to store bought ones.\n",
      "These cookies are delicious.  As a busy mom I don't have time to make home made cookies very often, but these are delicious.  They taste home made.  They aren't too sweet which is perfect for an oatmeal raisin cookie and they are perfectly soft.  These are perfect for a lunch box treat or for a road trip.  I will definitely purchase these again and try the other flavors.\n",
      "My Kids Loved these cookies and they are perfect for on the go. I will be buying again. Great product.\n",
      "We were able to try the raisin cookie and it was yummy! Both my kids love rasins and they really enjoyed this cookie. So much healthier then chocolate! Will be buying lots more.\n",

      "These new Quaker Soft Baked cookies are amazing! They are so soft and taste like they are fresh out of the oven! My free sample was so good it was gone before I could even share! I'm picking these cookies up at the store today so I can share them with the whole family! I also love the individual packaging so you can send them with the kids or whoever is on the go! Yummy!!\n",
      "Not a fan of Oatmeal but this cookie was so yummy........ very tasty and fresh like if I baked it myself fresh out the oven.\n",
      "These bars are so yummy! I was looking for a night snack and grabbed this out of my mom box from influenster and this hit the spot!\n",
      "I was able to try these cookies from @influenster and @Quaker oats.  This is a great soft chewy cookie.  I loved this so much that I went and bought another box of the chocolate almond flavor.  I will definitely buy more!!\n",
      "I am not crazy about cookies to begin with. I do however prefer Oatmeal Raisin than any other kind. I like my cookies well done and toasty, whereas these are super soft. They do taste great but just not my preference. My son loved it :D\n",
      "these are the BEST single serve cookies i have EVER had !! i have had other brands that were just had a wierd after taste i think because of the packeging, but these did not have that taste, all you taste is the amazing cookie\n",
      "I absolutely love this cookie. A great nutritous treat for the palate!!! Perfect for a quick on the go snack.\n",
      "I loved this cookie becuase it was soft and chewy. It is great for when your on the road and need a quick snack between work and a kid's game. Also makes a great treat for kids\n",
      "I received a sample of this cookie and loved it.  It was a great snack and will now be part of my grocery list.\n",
      "These cookies are absolutely delicious, I received one for review purposes from Influenster.com. I took a bite and gave the rest to my son, which was gone before I even had a chance to change my mind. LOL One of the moistest, most delicious cookies I have ever had, hands down. The only drawback that I found was that my cookies was broken into about 5 pieces, not sure what happened, but that doesn't effect the flavor!\n",
      "These cookies are so good. They taste homemade! Very tasty and healthy! Usually I only think oatmeal when I think of Quaker...I was wrong!I got a free sample from Influenster! :)  I will be buying for sure!\n",
      "When I tried the cookie I noticed that it was very soft, moist, and chewy. I usually do not like raisins, but they were very good in this. They actually tasted like homemade to me. And I grew up with a grandmother who always had fresh baked cookies in the kitchen. Having three kids of my own, of course I had to share with them. My son's comment on the cookie was, \"That's really yummy, Mommy!\" I am pretty sure we will be purchasing these in the future because my two boys keep asking if there is another cookie in my VoxBox.<br />I received a sample of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins in my MomVoxBox from Influenster for review purposes only. All opinions are my own.\n",
      "This cookie is so good, I received a sample from Influenster and when I opened it, it smelled like a homemade cookie...it tastes so fresh and it is filling, you only need one and you are good to go! I will be buying these in the future!\n",
      "Was very happy when I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster to try! I had seen them on commercials but never remembered to buy them when we went to the market, but I will definitely remember to buy them now!! What a delicious cookie and it is good for you too! Me and my son enjoyed our cookie with our lunch and it was a hit with both of us. It was such a soft and flavorful cookie that filled you up and left you satisfied. I will definitely be trying other varieties of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and will be recommending them to hall my friends!\n",
      "These cookies are very good. My daughter tried the sample and then I went out and bought a box. The whole family loves them. They are very soft and moist. It is a new snack in our household!\n",
      "I received an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie in a Influenster box and I loved it! Tasted just like a homemade cookie, really fresh and chewy. I would definitely buy more!\n",
      "These cookies where so great and yummy! took my candy craving away!  you should for sure buy this! The rasins are great and fufilling\n",
      "I received Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie as a sample in the mail. The cookie is really soft and a very nice size. The raisins taste very fresh and it's just like eating a freshly baked cookie; you could even put in the microwave for a bit to get the fresh oven baked feel.\n",
      "Received this in my influenster box my son Loved it! : )  Had to purchase more. It was nice to be able to try something to see if I liked it first before purchasing it.\n",
      "These cookies are very delicious! They are nice and soft so i could even give them to my 2 year old.\n",
      "This morning I gave my son a quaker oats rasin cookie for breakfast. When we took it out of the package it smelled amazing. I wish I was able to try this with him, but I have celiac and am gluten free. However my one year old son gobbled it up. It was super soft and chewy. There were visible oats and lots of rasins. I like that they were healthy. I did not mind giving this for breakfast as a treat because they are quaker oats!\n",
      "I don't usually like Oatmeal Raisin cookies, but when Influenster sent me this cookie to try, I did, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved it! So great, so soft, and so delicious. I definitely recommend that everyone try this cookie.\n",
      "I received this Quaker Soft Baked cookie from Influenster. This was my first time trying it and ohhh my!! It was fresh tasting. Very chewy and busting with flavor.\n",
      "I love these cookies!!!! They are very soft and actually taste like the homemade cookies your grandma would bake. Which is a great compliment to Quaker considering I think my Grandma is the best cookie baker ever! I also like that the cookies are a good snack that are not super high in calories. I will for sure be buying these cookies again and recommending them to all of my friends.\n",
      "I received this from Influenster in the Mom Voxbox. When I offered to my kids to try the Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookie I literally had a crying baby on my hands. She did NOT want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says \"I's MINE!\" Even getting a new box \"It's mine\" have to hide it.  Thanks!! Annette G\n",
      "I know they say \"soft baked\" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!  These are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry.\n",
      "We love these! They are so soft and tasty. They are a healthy filling snack. So easy to just stick in your bag and enjoy on the go!\n",
      "These were great! These cookies were soft and very tasty, almost like fresh baked.  They were much larger than I expected. Great product, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "This cookie was so soft, and delicious. I definitely plan on buying more! Perfect snack to have on the go or just at home with a glass of milk.\n",
      "The cookie is amazing, very soft. My daughters ages 4 years old and 10 months couldn't resist them. I had to buy another box right away.\n",
      "they are great, tasty and delicisous.  We even tried the banana nut ones, they were fantastic we loved them.  My kids loved them a great breakfast on the go...\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one.\n",
      "Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again.\n",
      "This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!\n",
      "As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )\n",
      "Quaker soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!\n",
      "I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening.\n",
      "I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these \"cookies\". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!\n",
      "This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!\n",
      "First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for \"store-bought.\" If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too.\n",
      "I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how Quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.<br /><br />For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.<br /><br />It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood.\n",
      "I loved these cookies! My daughter eat them right up. They are soft and taste great. I like softer cookies and this one was a hit with my whole family.\n",
      "Chock full of sugar!  Absolutely not something I would serve to my family.  Obviously, all cookies have sugar in them, but these seem to be a bit excessive.\n",
      "I recently received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.  I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two \"cookie monsters\" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)\n",
      "I got these in the Mom VoxBox from Influenster, and was excited to try them!<br />They are chewy and delish! I can see these disappearing and having an empty box sitting around!<br /><br />I'm not a fan of hard crunchy type cookies, so these were right up my alley!\n",
      "My 3 1/2 year old loved this cookie!  We shared it and I'm pretty sure he would have eaten the whole thing!  Very soft and th perfect amount of sweetness- not overly sweet like some oatmeal cookies tend to be.\n",
      "Very soft and chewy! Love the homestyle taste of the cookie and that it is very nutrious! Definetly gotta get some more!\n",
      "Well, let me start by saying these cookies are very soft and moist. However, I did not really like them. They were not sweet (which is a matter of personal preference) and they had a gritty texture to them.\n",
      "These cookies are delicious. They are full of flavor and taste moist and fresh. My kids loved them!!! My expectations were exceeded!\n",
      "This cookie is one of the best cookies that i have tried in a while since i do not like the hard crunchy ones like chips ahoy because it is so soft to the bite and pulls you in to make you want more. You can taste all the ingredents none are hidden and has a good amount of raisins in the cookie. I will be buying these for my family as long as they make them.\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy. I feel good about buying this because the ingredients are simple & I have used Quaker for years. Is a much better alternative than the other regular cookies you see in the store. Packed with raisins & whole grains. Great to pack, on road trips or just in your purse. Kid tested and approved! I received this product complimentary to test through Influenster's VoxBox program.\n",
      "I have absolutely fallen in love with the soft baked cookies! My kids love them, and I love them as a treat to munch on. However, they also can be used in delicious cookie crusts or cookie crumbles for recipes! They are so versatile and delicious! I definitely recommend them to everyone! my husband isn't even an oatmeal fan, but LOVES these cookies!!\n",
      "These cookies are to die for. I ate mine in a matter of seconds and was ready for the next one, but I only had one. I recommend these cookies for anyone kids, adults and the elderly. Its deliciously soft packed with raisins and yumminess!! Go to the store now and buy them, you sure wont be disappointed.\n",
      "These are soft, chewy, and delicious! They really do taste just like homemade cookies... with natural ingredients. They are a perfect treat, but still feel like a bit of a healthy snack as well.<br /><br />* I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster\n",
      "I let me daughter try some and I ate the rest. She isn't big on raisins but it was still good to her. I thought it was delicious because it was soft and tasted like it was just baked from the oven. I would highly recommend it and who doesn't love a good homemade cookie. Cause that's what it felt like to me. Like someone had just gave me a freshly baked cookie.\n",
      "I received this product through my Influenster Mom VoxBox. My son immediately ate it up and said to me it was \"the best he had ever had\". My son is four mind you! So this must mean something. I would definitely go out and buy some for my household after hearing that reaction :)\n",

      "I received a sample of the oatmeal cookies through Influenster, it was a large size cookie so I decided to split it with my husband and my 5 year old son, I didn't think my son would eat it but after his piece was gone he asked for more! Even my husband thought it was great and he does not really like oatmeal cookies. I will buy these now!\n",

      "I recently received a sample of this Quaker Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and I couldn't put it down.  The cookie is a nice big size and is full of flavor. Its not overly sweet and has that homebaked taste to it.  I can't wait to get more.\n",
      "I received one of these to try for free and review from Influenster in my mom Voxbox and I have to say, it was the softest, chewiest cookie I've ever had. This is saying a lot since I'm picky about cookies being soft and chewy. I'm anxious to try the other flavors. Especially the Apple Cinnamon one! Yum!\n",

      "I received a sample of this product from Influenster.com. They were delicious cookies I have to say. I don't usally reach for oatmeal cookies they are just not my favorite or my son's favorite. I love how homemade they taste. Nice and soft real taste of oatmeal and raisins. I will definetly continue buying some of these especially because enjoyed them!.\n",
      "These are SO yummy! They are incredibly soft and take me back to my childhood when my grandma would make oatmeal raisin cookies. My toddler loves them too!\n",
      "I have always loved Quaker brand products.  I had recieved a Oatmeal Rasin cookie through @influenster to try and review.  My boys actually were going to fight over who got to eat the cookie so I did the old one kid break it in half and the other one choose what half he wants trick.  They were left wanting more!  I have already repurchased these cookies several times in different flavors.  I am happy that they are good for them and make a great snack.\n",

      "If you like soft cookies, then these are for you. Great \"healthy\" snack! Don't  leave 'em in your gym bag though, you'll have a bag of good tasting crumbs!\n",
      "I really loved this cookie. The calories in it are not bad and the taste is great. I am always looking for a quick on the go breakfast and this hits the nail on the head. It would go amazingly with a cup of coffee. The cookie was soft and full of flavor. The only thing that I didn't love was it kind of had a salty after taste. If the sodium could be reduced just a smidgen then it would be the best cookie I have ever tasted. I would buy these if our commissary would carry them!\n",
      "I got a free sample via influenster, I'm not gonna lie the Quaker cookie was the first thing that caught my eye. First of its was so soft & chewy its just melts in your mouth. I definetly stocked up on the cookies. I tried the oatmeal cookie & its still my fav!!\n",

      "I've had other store bought cookies, these are better quality - more deluxe. I buy and bake a lot of gluten free for my son, so this was a real treat and just for me! A great snack for on the go.\n",
      "I really liked this cookie. It was very soft and chewy just how I like my cookies. The only problem was it could have been sweeter, maybe with some chocolate chips in with the raisins it would have been even better. I think for a quick breakfast great choice, not so much as a sweet though.\n",
      "taste amazing and  have that home baked feel. they are so soft and chewy. perfect with a glass of ice cold milk.\n",
      "I tried the raisin oatmeal cookies and they are so soft!  I am not a raisin fan but I still loved these and think they taste homemade!\n",

      "These cookies are so good that i eat them as a snack for when i am at work and they are simply the best. Love how they are soft and taste so good.\n",
      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are better than any homemade cookies I have tried or made. Which says alot considering I'm a former baker. They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies. They're especially great for on the go snacks.Also the price is very reasonable considering the quality you get. So if you're a cookie fan this one you have to try, you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "I had received a free sample cookie of the soft baked Quaker oatmeal cookie in raisins and my 6 yr old asked if he could have it. I told him he would have to share them with me.

      "These cookies are amazing! I got one from Influenster to review in my Mom VoxBox and my daughter loved it...  Soooo much that I bought 3 boxes at the store the next day! We have now tried the Apple Cinnamon, Oatmeal Raisin, and Banana Nut and can't decide which one we like more :)\n",
      "My kids and grandkids absolutely love these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies.  I thought maybe they wouldn't like them because of the raisins, but I don't think they even noticed them as they scarfed their way through the cookies.  I was able to get in a bit or two before they got ahold of them, and I agree, very good cookies!\n",
      "Super perfect all my kids love them,great snack anytime of day.Quci and easy snack and not feel guilty about.Enjoy enjoy enjoy.\n",
      "Soft Cookie, if you didn't unwrap yourself you would swear your grandma baked them...my girls are not oatmeal raisin fans, but they fight over my Quaker soft baked cookies, I keep these in my cubicle, they are my go to snack, if I had a nasty client I'll pop one in my mouth and take a time out. I am a big cookie fan and I like that these are individually wrapped and will stay fresh until I need one. I original received a sample from influenster website but have since purchased them since my girls ate my original influenster provided cookie.\n",
      "These are wonderful. I love love love soft cookies, and oatmeal raisin are my favorite! I mostly make my own cookies, but I would definitely purchase these! I got them compliments of Influenster & Quaker to test out, and my son & I love them!\n",

      "Quaker brand oatmeal cookies are the most delicious cookies!  They are moist and soft and the raisins are plump and just the right size. If you want a good \"home-baked\" taste in a cookie, these are the ones to get!\n",
      "Quaker Breakfast Cookies Oatmeal Raisin, 6-Count Boxes,10.1-Ounces  (Pack of 6)]]s.  They come in individually wrapped packages so you could use them as snacks for school, if you wish.  They are very soft and chewy and filled with a lot of raisins.  Very Tasty!  Kids will love them!\n",

      "I received this cookie from Influenster for testing purposes. As soon as I took it out of the box it was GONE! Can you say DELICIOUS! Me and my son both ate half. It has the best homemade taste. I love how it's super soft and just crumbles in your mouth and melts. BEST cookie ever!\n",
      "I received this product from influenster and i loved the oatmeal cookie type! They are perfect on the go and i just HAD to buy a box at the store when i saw them. They were gone in 2 DAYS!!! They are perfect for that sweet late night snack and even as a on the run breakfast! 5 stars!\n",

      "This cookie only lasted a few mins in my house. I my son ate most of it but I did get a couple bits of it & it was so soft, which is how I love my cookies, it was also very moist and nice & chewy. I will defiantly be buying these again.\n",
      "This is and amazing cookie! I received the Raisin cookie to try through influenster and was pleasantly surprised by its taste and texture. It truly is a very soft cookie and has a bold taste. Me and my two year old devoured this cookie then whet out to buy more! Would defiantly recommend.\n",
      "I really like these cookies. I am not a huge fan of raisins but these are so good. Nice and soft!\n",
      "These are awesome cookies! Nice and soft! Love!!! They great to give your kids for a snack or to take to work for a snack\n",
      "I loved these cookies! they have great flavor and taste! I loved them! They are great snacks for afterschool or a nice add on to any lunch. they come perpackaged so they do not dry out.\n",
      "I love chewy cookies! And these are definitely chewy. I love it. But the downside is that it's made in a place that manufactures peanuts. My Bubs is allergic to peanuts. =\\ So, he couldn't have any.\n",
      "I received this cookie courtesy of influenster, my family loves oatmeal cookies, and this one was awesome!! My son and I shared it, very soft and full of moist raisins! Will for sure look for these in the store! Can't wait to try others!\n",
      "I received a sample of these cookies through Influenster.It was gone within a minute of receiving the package.I didn't even share it,all mine lol.They are super soft and delicious!They taste like I just baked them myself.I have never tasted such an amazing cookie,for real!\n",
      "I received this sample of Quaker Soft Baked Cookie via Influenster to try. My husband grabbed it up quickly, He liked the taste but says the texture could be better it seemed to crumble very easily.\n",
      "these are very good. i didnt think they would be as moist as they were but they were melt in the mouth good :)\n",
      "These are really good. My husband and daughter fought over them!!  They are so soft and chewy and they taste like cinnamon.\n",
      "This is the perfect pick-me-up snack.  Great flavor and perfectly filling.  I quickly regretted sharing with my husband.  This snack is great for the entire family, and knowing we're making a healthier choice is a good feeling.\n",
      "I received a sample courtesy Influenster, well... I didn't have the pleasure to taste it myself, because my son got ahold of it and started munching away!!  He absolutely loved this cookie :)  And that's saying alot, since my son can not stand raisins, period!  I guess I'm gonna have to add this one to my grocery list :)\n",
      "I got a Quaker cookie to try in my Voxbox from Influenster. I gave it to my 8 year old son, who normally hates anything with raisins or anything remotely healthy, He loved it. Thanks Quaker for getting my child to eat something different.\n",
      "I received this cookie compliments of Quaker via Influenster to try. My son ate it so quick. I love Quaker and will be looking for these on our next grocery trip! My boy said it was delicious! We already buy the chewy oatmeal bars, adding these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies to our list of Quaket products!\n",
      "I received the Raisin flavored from Influenster complimentary for tasting.  It was very good to me, not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies. The fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better.  I am going to buy the cranberry & yogurt next.\n",
      "I love the home baked mom taste these have! Just like my mom made them! They are also easy to find and affordable!\n",
      "I rec'd this product from influenster and Quaker for testing purposes. I've always enjoyed Quaker oats from the hot oatmeal, down to the cookie itself. Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie is made with whole grain Quaker oats, At least 10 grams of whole grains per serving.<br />Made with real fruit, Good source of fiber, delicious. Quaker oats been around since over a hundred years.\n",
      "I received one of these awesome cookies from Influenster! They are DELICIOUS!! Super soft and moist...tasted home made! :) Yummy!\n",
      "These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins. This is only because I hate raisins. So if you like raisins then you would probably like them. I probably wouldn't repurchase this for myself because I would rather make homemade without them. I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins.\n",
      "Soft, chewy and just like Grandma used to make. I can't wait until I eat the next cookie as these are something to savor and enjoy!\n",
      "From Influenster I received the Quaker Soft Baked Cookie. With this product, after dinner one night, I divided it up into 3 equal portions. One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our 1 1/2 year old daughter.<br />Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.<br /><br />I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first.\n",
      "My whole family absolutely loves these cookies...so soft and yummy!  And I like the fact that they are a nutritious treat for the kids...a much better option than candy or soda.\n",
      "I loved how soft and delicious these cookies are! They are the new everyday snack in my house! Must have!\n",
      "I love the way these cookies taste just like homemade cookies. They are easy to take and eat on the go.\n",
      "I thought that I might have had tried some of the tastiest oatmeal cookis before, but that wasn't so until I recently tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies . These cookies are so delicious. They taste just like homeade cookies. They are soft , full of raisins, and are just fabulous.I bought a box at my locl Walmart the other day for $2.18 for eight cookies. These are a good size cookie too. Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from Quaker I can't wait to try out the different varieties that Quaker carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks Quaker!! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box! They were A+++.\n",
      "I love this soft bake cookie I recived from Quaker!<br />I enjoyed the Nutritious soft baked cookie and I plan to buy more for my family! great taste and Price!1\n",
      "The oatmeal raisin is the cookie that I've tried. I love it as well as my daughter. It's soft and tastes amazing. Not to mention cheap, I'll be buying more.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the goodness of Quaker Oatmeal combined with soft, plump and juicy raisins in a soft cookie. It is an irrisistable snack for the entire family and leaves you feeling full and satisfied.\n",
      "These cookies are so delicious.. I received one in my influenster mom voxbox and just had to repurchase.. So soft and chewy..def a must buy..happy customer over here..good job quaker\n",
      "I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail.\n",
      "These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more \"oatmealy\" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it.\n",
      "Came as an 8-pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about 1/4 inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!\n",
      "Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.\n",
      "Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack.\n",
      "Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with Quaker Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches.\n",
      "I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!\n",
      "As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again.\n",
      "I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up.\n",
      "I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled \"oatmeal\" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible.\n",
      "If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over.\n",
      "I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job, Quaker :)<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox.\n",
      "I received this cookie to test from Influenster.  I had the raisin cookie and it was really so good!  I like that they use whole grains to make the cookie.  Breakfast really isn't my favorite meal of the day and I like something that is fast and easy.  This cookie is a good breakfast option for me.  I'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  The cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.  I really liked it and will be buying more!\n",
      "I love how these Quaker soft baked cookies taste. I love them warmed up or cold, either way they are quick and easy to eat on the go.\n",
      "I really enjoyed the Quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie.  It's true...it tastes homemade!  Great for on the go when you need a treat or even for the kid's lunch boxes.\n",
      "Cookies are soft and so good! Taste just like a regular cookie! I received cookie complimentary from influenster in my mombox and was delighted with how good it was.\n",
      "These new Quaker Oat Soft Baked Cookies are amazing! Soft and chewy. Very fresh and like they were just baked the day you bought them. My kids love them and it's a great way to give them their whole gains with a small serving of fruit. They are also great to pack in for a snack or a low calorie desert at 170 calories per cookie! I love these and will continue to purchase!\n",
      "OMG....these are so good, better than I thought, they actually do taste home made, and I gotta say they taste even better than my grandmothers, sorry grams...:) I will definetly try these again, I got lucky and got to try a delicious sample from the influenster team :) I love quaker, and influenster.com\n",
      "I recieved this cookie FREE FROM INFLUENSTER.COM in their MOM VOXBOX 2012 THEME PRODUCT TESTING. and omg i loved it. it was soft and didnt taste so filling. it was light and great flavor tasting  i loved it\n",
      "Cookie is great and tasty. Tastes fresh. Very large in comparison to others related to the category. Very yummy. Will buy again.\n",
      "I received a sample of this product for free to test from Influenster and Quaker.  The cookie did not last long and I ended up going out to buy a whole new box.<br /><br />My son is three and he said the cookie tasted \"kind of like a muffin\" and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day.  The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for 10 seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren't individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  They are pretty great!  Oh, and they're not bad nutritionally... so go ahead and eat one for breakfast... I won't tell.\n",
      "These are the best oatmeal cookies ever! They're so soft and yummy. My whole family loves them,and I have a pretty picky family.\n",
      "I love these cookies! They are so soft and my daughter eats them without any problems.I am a big oatmeal cookie fan, but quakers are the best brand so far.\n",
      "This cookie was the bomb. It falls apart in your mouth...tastes fresh like grandma just brought it to you out of the oven! LOvvvee em!\n",
      "I tried the Oatmeal Raisin cookie and it was delicious.  The cookie is fairly big which is great.  It is soft and chewy so you don't have to worry about crumbs getting all over the place if your on the go.  I have already bought more!\n",
      "Well, if you ask my son, he might tell you it's better than his mommy's homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. :/ He loves the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and says they are \"Soft, chewy and Yummy!\" I'll be buying more!\n",
      "I Tried these after receiving a free sample from influencer.com, and they were delicious. Soft and chewy, with the perfect amount of raisins. They're a great size too. I will definitely buy some when they're available on amazon. My toddler loves them too.\n",
      "I found these cookies really moist and yummy. Good size and perfect for a snack break or for breakfast. My girls really liked them too. They remind of home made cookies. Good way to snack healthy.\n",
      "Loved my Quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good\n",
      "I really loved this cookie. It was soft and a bit chewy. I think that if I had not read the box I would not think they are good for you. Definitley a treat worth trying. I was totally satisfied and wished more came in a box!\n",
      "I received this product in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. I have tried other Quaker products and loved them. These were just as good as the rest. I love how soft and chewy this oatmeal cookie was. The raisins were nice and juicy as well. I can't wait to grab a bigger size box or bag or whatever they may come in. It is well worth it.\n",
      "I receive those cookies for review i love the flavor and all of it, i recommend 100%, my family love too, thanks quaker oatmeal cookier you are part of my family now!\n",
      "These cookies are so good an soft. When i had my wisdom teeth out after they healed I could not eat anything hard for a while an these cookies were so helpful even kids love them an there easy for on the go\n",
      "I was able to try this product through Influenster in my Mom Voxbox.  I had to share it with my 2 year old daughter since you can't eat cookies in front of kids lol!  It was delicious and soft baked, just like home made cookies.  My only complaint is that my cookie didn't have a good amount of raisins in it.  Maybe I just got a batch that missed a few extra raisins but I definitely felt that it could've used more.  Other than that, it was a great snack, especially to serve to kids!!  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)\n",
      "I am so surprised these are healthy because they taste so darn good. They are packed with flavors and the best party- they are deliciously chewy! I will be buying these immediately my next trip to the grocery store. My three year old loved it!\n",
      "I received this sample in my Influenster MOMVOXBOX and I must say I wish I had gotten more than just one cookie.  It was delicious.  Shared it with my husband and he liked equally as well.  Very moist and flavorful.\n",

      "I received the chocolate and almond Quaker oatmeal cookie free to try from #influenster in my #MomVoxBox, my 11 month old LOVED it!!

      "I didn't even know these existed until I received them in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. Luckily only one of my children was with me when I opened it. We shared the Oatmeal Raisin cookie, and we both thought it was wonderful! So much so, that I went out and found them at our grocery store. Try them warmed! Nice size, and very soft and chewy. So yummy!! I really would like to try the different flavors as well. A very tasty product!!\n",
      "I loved these cookies so much, they where nice and soft which I love in a cookie. They did not skimp on any flavor at all, I would buy these again and again.\n",
      "my kids love the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie. i was amazed they love a healthier cookie. i love it because its a healthy alternative and its made out of oatmeal.\n",
      "I was able to try this product because Influenster sent it to me in their #MomVoxBox for testing. Honestly I wasn't able to try it personally because my kids snatched it from me ha ha! But they enjoyed it a lot. They asked me if I would buy more and in different flavors too. Good and hearty snack for kids indeed! Thanks!\n",

      "These cookies are absolutely amazing. My three year doesnt like a lot of snacks and cookies and hes very picky, but he likes a couple of these flavors. They are very soft and very delicious and extremely tasty, you almost forget that they are healthy for you. I absolutely love quaker oatmeal and these cookies are an extra treat.\n",
      "From a he said she said point of view...<br /><br />He: (Who likes soft cookies) Thought they were good, chewy,  moist and delicious.<br /><br />She: (Who prefers a more crunchy cookie) I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it, taste was okay you could tell you were eating a whole grain cookie. The raisins saved this cookie for me.<br /><br />Over all we like Quaker Oats, we would buy this cookie if we has a coupon but not as a number one on our list.\n",
      "I was excited to receive a package of Quaker Soft Baked Cookies through Influenster to try out.  I was surprised at how reasonable the ingredients were and how low in fat the single serve package was.  The cookie itself tasted fresh, soft and delicious.

      "I was choosen as one of @Influensters Mom VoxBox recipients. I was excited about that, but I was even more excited when I opened it to see that there was a Quaker Oatmeal soft baked cookie inside. I immediately opened it. It's one of the softest and most delicious cookies I have had in a long time. I immediately had two of my kids try a piece of it also. They loved it also! These cookies are rich in flavor, not dry, and all around a great cookie. I went out yesterday and bought two more boxes of them. These are a great product to keep handy for snack time! Absolutely love them!\n",

      "My son and I both loved Quaker's Soft Baked cookies! I received a sample in the Mom VoxBox via Influenster. I've never been a fan of the hard type cookies so I loved how soft and chewy these ones were. Since my son is still a toddler, I think they were soft enough for him and his little teeth to chew and eat. Plus they were just plain delicious!\n",
      "I received this product from influenster in my mom voxbox 2012 to test out. My grab grabbed the cookie of the box and hid...he has been begging me for more ever since. Unfortunately they don't sell them in m local grocery store yet but next time I go out of town I plan on purchasing more!!!\n",
      "yummy great cookie just like my momma makes this is deffinietely a second best of course after my moms cooking love how soft and chewy they are a must buy\n",
      "I recieved this product for free to test from Influenster for promotional reasons. Me and my daughters ages 4 and 7 all tried the cookie and we loved it. It taste great and it really is soft. My local store didnt have The Quaker SOft baked oatmeal raisin cookie so I bought the breakfast version of it and I love it as well. The cookies are great for all ages!!! I would recommend this cookie to people.\n",
      "I was selected by Influenster to get a mom Voxbox.  Inside with other products I got a full size sample of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies.  My daughter was so happy with it.  I was able to steal a small amount from her...It was so yummy and soft.  It was a nice size too. It was not small at all and you will get your moneys worth.  The fact that it has oatmeal is a plus, meaning my kids are putting something healthy in them when they are snacking.  I will definetely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone.  If you want a yummy soft cookie with lots of flavor with none of the work and clean up after baking...go get a box of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies...you won't be sorry. :-) I know my kids are happy that I tryed it....Thanks again Influenster and Quaker.\n",

      "I got one package (one cookie) in my Mom VoxBox. I only got one bite because my husband Ate the rest, He Loved it!!!! A+++\n",
      "Influenster sent me a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test out and review in the Mom voxbox! WOW!! SO GOOD! And it really is so soft, if feels and tastes fresh baked. I only have one question, what took them so long to make these?? =) Really they are so good you wonder why they haven't thought of this years ago!<br />Here are a few of the details! They are individually packaged, so they are great for on the go! They are made with yummy whole grain Quaker oats! They are a good source of fiber and only have 6 grams of total fat per serving! I know you are dying to know where you can get these now! You can buy them at pretty much any major retailers and have a suggested retail of $2.69 for 6 cookies, That's less than $0.50 a cookie! Great deal! Give them a try and let me know how you like tem!\n",
      "I love all of Quaker's products and so I didn't expect anything less from these cookies. I was not disappointed. The cookies are soft, chewy, and filling. They have the right amount of cinnamon and rasins in them. My kids even like them which is hard when it comes to oatmeal. I would definitely recommend these cookies if you love oatmeal rasin cookies.\n",
      "I already loved Quaker products, I grew up on them. This did not disappoint. Its a soft cookie, its a fulfilling treat and it has fiber :)\n",
      "I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster via the mom vox box campaign to try and review, and i love this product!! Its soft, tasty, healthy, and its mom approved!!

      "I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster to try-then immediately went out and bought 2 more boxes, which are now gone also. These cookies have such a great homebaked consistency and just the right amount of spice and sugar. My kids love them too, especially when we cut them in half and put a little ice cream between the halves.\n",
      "I received this from influenster in my mom voxbox omg i love the cookie i got only one sample i when to buy 4 more box's my family love's it thanks Influenster and Quaker!\n",
      "I was not sure what to think about this product when it first came out because really its one more cookie and could it really be soft.  Well, Quaker delivered!  I love these cookies, they are great for any time including breakfast.\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins is very good. Nice and soft. Easy to break into smaller pieces to eat. Highly recommend trying this product.\n",
      "My whole family enjoyed the yummy goodness of Quaker oatmeal cookies with raisins. My 3 year old couldn't get enough of them. It reminded me of my grandma's home made cookies. The taste brought me back to my childhood when I would help my grandma bake. So soft and I could taste the wholesome goodness in each bite. I will be buying more soon!\n",
      "I received this from influenster in my mom voxbox and my kids loved this cookie. I didn't even get a chance to try it and had to purchase a box. I highly recommend this cookie... Its a great snack and a healthier one!!!!\n",
      "The Quaker Brand soft cookies are so good! They are yummy and soft and really fill you up! So easy on the go with the kids or if your just relaxing at home with some milk!\n",

      "These cookies are delicious! So soft and flavorful. My fave! My first time trying these cookies was a couple of weeks ago, and I will defiantly recommend.\n",
      "Such a tasty cookie... soft, flavorful.  Mmm.<br /><br />I was highly surprised at how good these were.  Yum!  The portion was quite generous, making for a nice afternoon snack.\n",
      "My kids really like to eat the quaker oatmeal soft cookies in the morning<br /> for breakfest with a big glass of milk! :)\n",
      "My whole family loved this cookie! It is very soft and tastes great! It was so soft that my 8 month old even got to enjoy it, too!\n",
      "The cookie is soft and flavorful. It tastes good and the raisins are moist. My only complaint is the the cookie didn't stay together. It breaks apart very easily,\n",
      "I really loved the taste of these cookies. They tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies. They seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies. I used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind. I would definitely buy these again.\n",
      "i like to buy them for my kids they love them and theyre also good for them, they are soft and chewy healthy and the taste is great\n",
      "These cookies are amazing! Great for snacks for the children. Nutritious yet satisfying. Will keep purchasing more of these. Amazing great taste.\n",
      "What a great snack for on the run, in a purse or diaper bag, or even for a quick treat at home! Was delicious and pretty healthy compared to some cookies!\n",
      "We tried the soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies and fell in love with them! Being a mom and constantly on the go its hard to find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag, purse, lunch box or car. I would recommend these to every one:)\n",
      "I shared these with my toddler. We both loved them. They are soft and practically melt in your mouth. They are so soft and delicious. The fact that they are healthy also helps and makes me feel great about giving them to my kids.\n",
      "As Soon as I received my sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox from influenster.com my 2 yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why. They taste very fresh and everyone loves them!<br />I got to try this product for free in my MomVoxBox from Influenster.com<br />I'm an Influenster and Influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!\n",
      "Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies.\n",
      "I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with.\n",
      "I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range.\n",
      "When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from Quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+\n",
      "I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings.\n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?\n",
      "Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.\n",
      "I must admit this was one great product. Not only did I enjoy these my son's did as well . They were a big hit today at my sons birthday party and I intend to keep purchasing!! Great job!\n",
      "I receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious I have never tried these but I would recommend them to anyone\n",
      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 4:14 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.\n",
      "I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!\n",
      "I loved this cookie! I received it in my mom vox box from influenster, and that was the first thing me and my daughter tried. (: She absolutely loved it, and I will be buying more and put them in my diaper bag, for on the go trips (:\n",
      "Hello, I received this cookie in my @influenster Mom VoxBox to review and i have to say i was very pleased with the taste, texture and the enormous size of the cookie. I am happy with Quaker Products, i always have been ever since i was little. I now pass the nutritional products to my children as my grandma passed it on to me.\n",
      "I like the cookies while on the go.  They are soft and chewy and have the goodness of Quaker products.  If you don't have time to bake, then give these cookies a try.  They taste great.  I sampled the product thanks to Influenster and I am so thankful for that!\n",
      "i recived a free sample from Influenster and let me tell you it was so good and soft it crumbles up right in your mouth and its a big cookie my daughter also loved it i would difenitly recommend buying it if you like oatmeal and raisins\n",
      "These cookies are a great quick snack for the kids. They did not even complain about the raisins, I think they gobble them up before they even notice!\n",
      "I received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box. These are super soft cookies that are individually wrapped for convenience. The individually wrapped cookie is a huge feature here as the cookies stay fresh and soft in a easily tote-able package. You get the great taste of Quaker oat cookies without the work of baking them! Toss in the kids lunch bag, spouse lunch box, pack for a picnic, use in birthday party favor bags for a healthy alternative! Great tasting, great portability, great texture. love them!!\n",
      "My children love these cookies. They are very soft and taste awesome. Will be buying more for sure.The best cookies we ever tried.\n",
      "These cookies were so soft and yummy. You would think they were fresh out of the oven. I will definitely be getting more of these for my house :O)\n",
      "My whole family loves these cookies. And my son tried to stuff the whole thing in his mouth. I just bought some yesterday & I think I will have to get some more soon.\n",
      "My kids loved these and they are great to just take and run out the door with for little snack. Get some of our own!\n",
      "I have fallen in love with Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie! I tried them in my mom voxbox from Influenster and it was so good. It tasted like a homemade cookie to me. I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the Quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend Quaker.\n",
      "i love these soft cookies. they taste like fresh baked out of the oven. the oatmeal is very sweet and tasty\n",
      "I absolutely loved these new cookies. They were so soft and yummy. The kids also enjoyed them. I saw them in the store also and they price wasn't bad. I'll be a returning customer for these.\n",
      "I received this amazing Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom VoxBox. I'm normally not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies since I don't like raisins, but this was delicious! The cookie was thick and tasted homemade with a nice oatmeal flavor. I'm definitely going to buy more of these.\n",
      "I got this from Influenster in my mom voxbox,  it was very soft and tasty my husband said, as he was the one who ate it lol!\n",
      "I got these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, and they were really good. They were moist and yummy. I don't like raisins so I picked them out, but the oatmeal was amazing. I will definitely buy some more. Well, a flavor without raisins in them.\n",
      "I got one of these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox! OMG they were so good, My daughter and I shared the first one then i went and got another box! This are a must have now! They are great to snack on. They are super soft. There is nothing bad to say about these cookies. You must try them!\n",
      "A decadent go to treat!! Nice to keep around the house for quick meals, toss them in homemade ice cream for a yummy flavor or just grab one when you have a sweet tooth!\n",
      "~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take \"on-the-go\" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains 6 grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain Quaker Oats! You can't beat that! Try them out, I'm sure you'll love them as much as I did! =D\n",
      "The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.\n",
      "My kids or I didn't care for it much, they tossed it after a few bites, and what kids throw away cookies????\n",
      "If I could give it zero stars I would......horrible taste and not much of that either. Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives Quaker a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment....\n",
      "These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others.\n",
      "I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again.\n",
      "this cookie is super soft and chewy.i love it and also try their oatmeal cookies,they are the bomb diggitty!!!i would recommend this to everyone.i received this in my mom voxbox and my kids loved it!!\n",
      "These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one.\n",
      "THIS IS A FAB PRODUCT SOFT AND CHEWY YOU CANT GO WRONG ME AND MY KIDS LOVE THEM MY TWO YEAR OLD IS HARD FOR HIM TO SHARE HE SAYS NO MY COOKIE LOL\n",
      "I loved these cookies and so did my kids. You can read my full review here [...] My favorite part was definitely the taste, and I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan.\n",
      "This is a great tasting cookie. It is very soft and the texture is very smooth. I usually do not like oatmeal cookies because the texture is very gritty and tough. This cookie does not have that problem. It tastes like your Mom just made it.\n",
      "These are great for a quick snack! They are satisfying even if you have a sweet tooth. I love that they are whole grain and have fiber! Delicious, just wish there weren't raisins in them!\n",
      "I love the Quaker soft baked cookies.  The really are soft and taste great.  I tried the oatmeal raisin, and cant wait to try the other flavors.  They all look really good.\n",
      "This cookie is really good and works really well for my family.  In the morning it fits in to my morning routine.  I take the cookie put it in the microwave and out the door we go with my tea.  Something I can eat at my desk or on the run.  It holds me over till lunch and is not too heavy.\n"

      "190733    see update at end of review<br /><br />******************<br /><br />I was lamenting about only having frech lettuce, herbs, chives, and tomatoes from may garden during the long fall-winter-spring parts of the year. The refrigerated stuff from the grocery store goes bad right away and does not taste as good as the fresh stuff from the garden, either.<br /><br />Then I saw a Time Magazine page on the new AeroGrow AeroGarden, and I just had to try it out. After reading the AeroGrow website before making the purchase, I realized that buying one garden would not work for me, as the tomatoes cannot be grown in the same garden as lettuce & herbs. This is partially due to the large amount of room taken up by the tomatoes, and also because the lamp/watering cycle is different and finally because the nutrients are different.<br /><br />So, I bought two gardens, along with the Salad Greens seed kit and Cherry Tomato seed kit. Each garden comes with a mixed herb kit, so I figured to mix in a few herbs with the other seeds, and if they did not work, no big loss.<br /><br />The products came quickly and the instructions for assembly were very clear and well written with excellent diagrams. I came to realize that this somewhat pricey product at least comes from a company that produces a classy product (a rare thing these days). I found a space on a shelf beside the basement stairs, and placed both assembled gardens there. I also bought and placed a digital thermometer with maximum/minimum temperature memory readouts ($10 at Radio Shack), because I was unsure of what temperature extremes the plants might experience in that location (68-72 as it turns out).<br /><br />The seed kits contain pre-seeded planting pods. Each pod is basically a plastic cup shaped frame with two pieces of foam rubber inside the cup part, like two slices of bread with the seeds sandwiched between them. They simply insert into the seven holes in the top of the garden's water tank. The Salad Greens and Herbs come with seven pods per kit, while the Tomatos come with three pods plus four hole plugs-the plants are bigger so three of them take up thw whole space available. The hole plugs prevent evaporation of the water through the unoccupied holes.<br /><br />The water tank holds exactly one gallon of regular drinking water. Well water is not recommended, presumably because of impurities, and since I am on a well I bought two one-gallon plastic jugs of 'drinking water' at the store for 50 cents each and filled the tanks with their contents. A pump in the tank takes water and pipes it to the rim of each of the seven holes in the tank's top, and here the trickle of water flows into the foam sandwich of each seed pod. The foam stays moist and the rest of the water drips back down into the tank. The garden's 'computer' cycles the water flow on and off according to the amount recommended for the type of plant being grown. A water level sensor turns on a flashing red light when it is time to add more water to the tank.<br /><br />The top of the garden is a reflector with two compact-fluorescent lamps, of the variety that has the special ultraviolet (UV) coating that causes the emmitted light to resemble sunlight. The reflector rides on a vertical pole that extends up from the garden's base, so you can raise and lower the lamps as required to keep them the correct distance above the plants. The garden's 'computer' also turns the lamps on and off according to a schedule tailored to the type of plant. If using the gardens in a place where the light might be a problem at night, you can syncronize the computer so that the lights are on only during the daytime and off when you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />The seed kits come with little clear plastic cups that cover each pod until the seeds have germinated, then you can dispose of them. The kits also come with a bag of nutrient tablets, which you add to the water tank when the computer prompts you to by flashing a red light. The nutrients are tailored to the type of plant being grown, and there are enough of them to feed the plants during their anticipated life span.<br /><br />I planted one garden with five salad green (leaf lettuce) pods, plus one pod each from the Herb kit, chives and parsley. The other garden got the threee pods from the Cherry Tomato kit; two reds and one yellow variety.<br /><br />Each seed pod has a label that tells you how many days to wait for plants to appear after germination. All of my plants appeared like clockwork.<br /><br />I have had the gardens for about six weeks now, and have been enjoying salads containing lettuce, parsley and chives plus other odds and ends from the fridge, for the last two or three weeks. The lettuce and herbs are all beautiful, with no problems from bugs or too much/too little water, excessive temperatures, etc. No need to wash the plants or check for bugs or pick off bad spots, everything goes straight to the salad bowl. What a joy! Even with only five lettuce plants, I have to eat two meals including salad each day to keep up with the growth. This would easily feed two people, and if all seven salad green pods had been used, three people.<br /><br />The tomatoes are all doing well ahnd have been pruned according to instructions. It will be some time yet before they produce flowers, and then fruit. But based on the health of the plants, I expect a good yield.<br /><br />Each seed kit comes with a full color manual/booklet that covers all aspects of 'planting', germinating, feeding, pruning (if required) and then harvesting the plants. There are also photos of plants where things have gone wrong (leaves burned because the lamps were not raised up as the plants grew taller, etc) with clear instructions on how to recognize problems and correct them. Harvesting instructions clearly tell how much can be taken at a time without killing the plant, and so on.<br /><br />The AeroGrow gardens are a well designed, well built product with excellent documentation. All my visitors are amazed at how well the product works, and many have gone out and bought their own. I anticipate years of improved eating because of this product.<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Update November 2007<br /><br />I used my two gardens all Winter (2006/2007) until it was time to start getting produce from my real (outdoor) garden in the Summer, at which time I put the little gardens to rest for the season. During their use, I got a large crop of cherry tomatoes, all of which were beautiful. I went through on crop of lettuce and salad greens, and when the lettuce finally bolted, I replanted with only lettuce (no chives, etc this time) and got another couple of months worth of lettuce. I have now fired them up again in the Fall, and have nice little plants popping up. Aerogrow has more seed options available now, so I have planted a more interesting kind of lettuce.\n",

      "Good opportunity to sample some of the various Timothy's k-cup selections and find your favorites. You can't beat the convenience and consistency of the k-cup system. Since I don't see that Amazon provided a description of what's included in the variety pack.....<br /><br />Includes two of each of the following varieties: Breakfast Blend, Kona, Parisian Nights, Espresso Extra Bold, Colombian Dorado, Italian Blend, Hazelnut, Colombian Decaf., Chai Tea, Green Tea ,English Breakfast Tea & Canarino.\n",

      "This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"stand\" in order to fill it properly.\n",

      "Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!\n",

      "To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words \"Medium Extra Bold\" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.\n",

      "Nutiva's Organic coconut oil is the best I've found.  I've tried several brands, but nothing tastes as clean and pure as this.  There is a definite undertone of coconut, but I like the flavor, even when frying eggs or eating it on cinnamon raisin toast. I recently had bloodwork done and my HDL (the good cholesterol) was an impressive 77---anything over 39 is considered in range; over 50 is heart protective).  I attribute this great HDL number to using only coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in my cooking & drinking green tea.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer is a great deal; I really like the 2 pack of these smaller (15 oz) jars.  We're a small household and I like keeping one jar sealed while using the other.  Keep in mind that coconut oil is different than other oils--it is solid at temperatures under 72, so it will look something like shortening in the wintertime.  Still tastes great and is wonderful to use in all kinds of cooking.<br /><br />One more important detail:  this is an organic, COLD PRESSED coconut oil.  Others may be organically grown, but I've found some brands are hydrogenated to make them solid at room temperature (I won't go into all the reasons this is not a \"good thing\").  Suffice it to say that any coconut oil you buy should be cold pressed (and that goes for your olive oil, as well).  Google to find out why...<br /><br />Happy eating!\n",

      "see update at end of review<br /><br />******************<br /><br />I was lamenting about only having frech lettuce, herbs, chives, and tomatoes from may garden during the long fall-winter-spring parts of the year. The refrigerated stuff from the grocery store goes bad right away and does not taste as good as the fresh stuff from the garden, either.<br /><br />Then I saw a Time Magazine page on the new AeroGrow AeroGarden, and I just had to try it out. After reading the AeroGrow website before making the purchase, I realized that buying one garden would not work for me, as the tomatoes cannot be grown in the same garden as lettuce & herbs. This is partially due to the large amount of room taken up by the tomatoes, and also because the lamp/watering cycle is different and finally because the nutrients are different.<br /><br />So, I bought two gardens, along with the Salad Greens seed kit and Cherry Tomato seed kit. Each garden comes with a mixed herb kit, so I figured to mix in a few herbs with the other seeds, and if they did not work, no big loss.<br /><br />The products came quickly and the instructions for assembly were very clear and well written with excellent diagrams. I came to realize that this somewhat pricey product at least comes from a company that produces a classy product (a rare thing these days). I found a space on a shelf beside the basement stairs, and placed both assembled gardens there. I also bought and placed a digital thermometer with maximum/minimum temperature memory readouts ($10 at Radio Shack), because I was unsure of what temperature extremes the plants might experience in that location (68-72 as it turns out).<br /><br />The seed kits contain pre-seeded planting pods. Each pod is basically a plastic cup shaped frame with two pieces of foam rubber inside the cup part, like two slices of bread with the seeds sandwiched between them. They simply insert into the seven holes in the top of the garden's water tank. The Salad Greens and Herbs come with seven pods per kit, while the Tomatos come with three pods plus four hole plugs-the plants are bigger so three of them take up thw whole space available. The hole plugs prevent evaporation of the water through the unoccupied holes.<br /><br />The water tank holds exactly one gallon of regular drinking water. Well water is not recommended, presumably because of impurities, and since I am on a well I bought two one-gallon plastic jugs of 'drinking water' at the store for 50 cents each and filled the tanks with their contents. A pump in the tank takes water and pipes it to the rim of each of the seven holes in the tank's top, and here the trickle of water flows into the foam sandwich of each seed pod. The foam stays moist and the rest of the water drips back down into the tank. The garden's 'computer' cycles the water flow on and off according to the amount recommended for the type of plant being grown. A water level sensor turns on a flashing red light when it is time to add more water to the tank.<br /><br />The top of the garden is a reflector with two compact-fluorescent lamps, of the variety that has the special ultraviolet (UV) coating that causes the emmitted light to resemble sunlight. The reflector rides on a vertical pole that extends up from the garden's base, so you can raise and lower the lamps as required to keep them the correct distance above the plants. The garden's 'computer' also turns the lamps on and off according to a schedule tailored to the type of plant. If using the gardens in a place where the light might be a problem at night, you can syncronize the computer so that the lights are on only during the daytime and off when you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />The seed kits come with little clear plastic cups that cover each pod until the seeds have germinated, then you can dispose of them. The kits also come with a bag of nutrient tablets, which you add to the water tank when the computer prompts you to by flashing a red light. The nutrients are tailored to the type of plant being grown, and there are enough of them to feed the plants during their anticipated life span.<br /><br />I planted one garden with five salad green (leaf lettuce) pods, plus one pod each from the Herb kit, chives and parsley. The other garden got the threee pods from the Cherry Tomato kit; two reds and one yellow variety.<br /><br />Each seed pod has a label that tells you how many days to wait for plants to appear after germination. All of my plants appeared like clockwork.<br /><br />I have had the gardens for about six weeks now, and have been enjoying salads containing lettuce, parsley and chives plus other odds and ends from the fridge, for the last two or three weeks. The lettuce and herbs are all beautiful, with no problems from bugs or too much/too little water, excessive temperatures, etc. No need to wash the plants or check for bugs or pick off bad spots, everything goes straight to the salad bowl. What a joy! Even with only five lettuce plants, I have to eat two meals including salad each day to keep up with the growth. This would easily feed two people, and if all seven salad green pods had been used, three people.<br /><br />The tomatoes are all doing well ahnd have been pruned according to instructions. It will be some time yet before they produce flowers, and then fruit. But based on the health of the plants, I expect a good yield.<br /><br />Each seed kit comes with a full color manual/booklet that covers all aspects of 'planting', germinating, feeding, pruning (if required) and then harvesting the plants. There are also photos of plants where things have gone wrong (leaves burned because the lamps were not raised up as the plants grew taller, etc) with clear instructions on how to recognize problems and correct them. Harvesting instructions clearly tell how much can be taken at a time without killing the plant, and so on.<br /><br />The AeroGrow gardens are a well designed, well built product with excellent documentation. All my visitors are amazed at how well the product works, and many have gone out and bought their own. I anticipate years of improved eating because of this product.<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Update November 2007<br /><br />I used my two gardens all Winter (2006/2007) until it was time to start getting produce from my real (outdoor) garden in the Summer, at which time I put the little gardens to rest for the season. During their use, I got a large crop of cherry tomatoes, all of which were beautiful. I went through on crop of lettuce and salad greens, and when the lettuce finally bolted, I replanted with only lettuce (no chives, etc this time) and got another couple of months worth of lettuce. I have now fired them up again in the Fall, and have nice little plants popping up. Aerogrow has more seed options available now, so I have planted a more interesting kind of lettuce.\n",

      "I bought an AeroGarden for my wife back in May.  I'll start with the positives:  It's a clever, generally well-designed item that generally functions well and is a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's really great to have easy access to fresh herbs.  In fact, if not for my one big complaint, I'd seriously consider getting another AeroGarden, so we could grow a greater variety and have a continuous supply of herbs.<br /><br />However, there's a fundamental design problem with the AeroGarden's pump.  After having the AeroGarden for about a month, the pump became terribly noisy, to the point where it could be heard vibrating in adjacent rooms.  After running through a few steps with customer service, they sent me a new pump.  However, because they've apparently had so many problems with the pumps, they were back-ordered and it took about three or four weeks for the replacement to arrive.  Once I replaced the pump, the AeroGarden was again a welcome cohabitant, virtually silent except for the gentle sound of water trickling through the system.<br /><br />All was fine until I pulled out the last crop of plants and inserted new seed pods and nutrients.  I thoroughly cleaned out the reservoir unit, but within a few days, the pump (a replacement) started getting noisy.  I just called AeroGrow's customer service department and they are shipping another pump.<br /><br />The customer service folks have been very helpful, but they've acknowledged that there's a design problem.  The pumps get noisy because tiny bits of root or nutrients get past the foam filter in the base unit, then get sucked into the pump's impeller.  A small nick in the impeller throws off the balance of the pump and they become increasingly noisy.  The only answer--at this point--is to periodically replace the pump.<br /><br />So, just a little shy of four months into AeroGarden ownership, I will soon be on my third pump.  I'm hopeful that they'll get this figured out at some point.  They're very understanding and helpful in replacing the noisy pumps, but it appears to me that there's a fundamental design problem.  As much as I like the AeroGarden when it's functioning as it's supposed to, I can't in good conscience recommend buying one at this time.  I'd wait until they get this problem sorted out.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />The third pump did the trick.  I haven't had to replace it since.  I'm not changing my rating, however.  Overall, I like the AeroGarden, but their seed pod packages are overpriced and underperform.  The tomato garden was a total bust--lots of leaves, but not a single tomato--and the herb gardens always include one or two plants that die out within a few weeks.  Some herbs consistently do well--basil and parsley come immediately to mind--but others just wither and die (and, yes, I'm very careful about water levels, nutrients, and trimming the herbs appropriately).<br /><br />I think they could do a much better job of selecting quality plants that would actually perform well.  Since this has been a consistent theme with each of the herb packages I've tried, I have to assume that most purchasers will have the same problems.\n",

      "I ordered one of these Fresh \"Whole\" Rabbits, but when it arrived its head, fur and insides were missing.  Not exactly whole, I'd say!  Maybe it was just damaged during shipping, but I won't be buying another one.  I mean - without the long ears, how do I know it even WAS a rabbit?  It was the same size and shape as a cat...not that I've seen a cat with its head, fur and insides missing.  I mean, not like really close or anything.<br /><br />On the plus side, it was delicious with a tall, cold glass of Tuscan Milk, so I give it three stars.  That's three WHOLE stars, BTW.\n",

      "Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not \"coconut milk,\" although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut, the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut, that is, NOT from a Tetrapak.)<br /><br />Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called \"the tree of Life,\" because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food, water, shelter, medicine, etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet, but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters.<br /><br />Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery, unsweetened tapioca, with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself, but mixes easily with fruit juices, etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink, because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties, and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food.<br /><br />Good organic coconut water is very hard to find, but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendor's web site, but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits, nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested, the quality of the land and processing, etc. That is not a good sign.<br /><br />For an item that is very health oriented, the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance, or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations, especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy, environmentally sound plantations, and making that a very prominent part of their marketing.<br /><br />It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product, not just general properties. This company doesn't do any of that, so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted, I am fussier than most in this regard.<br /><br />Don't be misled by the \"100% Natural\" marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict, legally defined standard, as is \"USDA Organic,\" for example. Virtually anything found in \"nature,\" i.e. toxic heavy metals, MSG (yes, it occurs in nature), animal manure, etc., can be considered \"natural\" and can legally be included in a product labeled \"100% Natural.\" Granted, USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say, Oregon Tilth), but they are still better than nothing.<br /><br />While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars, the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY, VERY suspicious. Without more information about how safe/healthy the product actually is, I can only give it 3 stars and a serious \"caveat emptor.\" It is probably much better than any ordinary \"sports drinks,\" but there are too many unanswered questions to be sure. One's health is not something to be treated lightly.<br /><br />UPDATE July 2009:<br /><br />After continued searching, I still have not been able to locate a consistent source of organic or Fair Trade coconut water. While the manufacturer of this coconut water still does not give out any real information about the growing, harvesting, or other relevant details of production, neither do any of their competitors.<br /><br />So far, this is still the best coconut water I have been able to find, and I continue to drink it, even with the questions I have.\n",

      "This product is called \"Hunmatsu-RyokuCha,\" in Japanese, and not the same as \"Maccha\" or \"Matcha.\"<br />The translation for Hunmatsu Ryokucha and Maccha are actually the same, green tea powder.<br />However, the ingredient for Maccha is a special kind of tea called \"Tencha,\" in Japanese, and has unique \"Umami.\"<br />\"Tencha\" is grown in the shade in order to prevent the final product from developing certain astringent bitterness, called \"Shibumi,\" in Japanese.  There are many kinds of bitterness.  i.e. For Maccha, it is not necessary true that bitterness is bad.  Actually, the first grade Maccha is more bitter than the low grade Maccha, given you are comparing amongst REAL Maccha powder.<br /><br />The process of producing REAL Maccha is much more complicated and painstaking than Hunmatsu-Ryokucha.<br />Hunmatsu-Ryokucha is ground regular Sencha Green Tea that are casually served all over Japan in regular household.  (Sorry, I am struggling with English.)  But one must understand that the kind of tea plants, the way they grow the tea plants, the way they process the tea leaves, are all different, not only in Japan, but also in any countries.<br /><br />(If you can read Chinese Characters...) Hunmatsu-Ryokucha consists of 4 Chinese Characters, Hunmatsu means powder, Ryokucha means green tea; however, Maccha sonsists of two Chinese Characters.  Maccha means special green tea powder intended for tea ceremony.  And we, Japanese, don't drink Maccha regularly.  Most Japanese don't know a lot about tea ceremony either.  (As most Japanese are not martial artists....)<br /><br />In the United States, Asian Grocery Store sells both Hunmatu Ryokucha and Maccha.  The real Maccha is usually in a nice tiny tin can, and the amount included is about 28g (about 1 oz), priced about 9 - 10 dollars each.  I don't think that any country but Japan produces Maccha, but I might be wrong.  However, if the green tea powder is produced in Taiwan, China, Korea,and other Asian countries, it is most likely to be Hunmatsu Ryokucha, NOT Maccha.  The same product sold at this vendor is much cheaper at Asian Grocery Store since you don't have to pay for S/H.<br /><br />The advantage of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha over Maccha is that the former has higher nutritional value, which I don't want to discuss in this site.  But the cancer preventing effect in this cheap powder is higher than more expensive Maccha.<br /><br />The disadvantage of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha over Maccha is of course, \"Shibumi\" (the closest direct translation is astringency.)  That's why you may feel it is more bitter than Maccha.  The powder is probably coarser than the Maccha.<br /><br />You may use Hunmatsu-Ryokucha for baking and dessert making, in the same way as you use Maccha. But the flavor and taste are definitely different.<br /><br />I have not tried Starbucks Maccha Latte.  But I assume that they use the low grade Maccha powder since, amongst real Maccha, the low grade Maccha is less bitter than the premium quality Maccha for tea ceremony, I heard.<br /><br />To conclude, if your purpose is to enjoy REAL Maccha flavor, you should not purchase this product.<br />But if your purpose is simply for your health, this product is better than Maccha.  However, you should research availability and cost comparisons of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha products by actually going to the Asian Grocery Stores.  You may get better price than this.  (Actually, I am pretty sure that you get better prices locally.)  Most Vietnamese owned grocery stores have Hunmatsu-Ryokucha in stock, not to mention Japanese and Korean owned grocers.<br /><br />Also, Hunmatsu-Ryokucha is popular in Japan, too.  Thus not all green tea powder imported from Japan is \"Maccha.\"<br /><br />If you want to buy the quality Maccha, you should find the Japanese Grocery Store (owened by Japanese) and ask specifically \"Maccha\" for tea ceremony.  And if you are not satisfied, sign up for tea ceremony class taught by a tea ceremony master.<br /><br />For the seller, one must not include \"Matcha\" or \"Maccha\" in the descriptions or titles, if the product was just \"Hunmatsu-Ryokucha.\"  As I wrote earlier, these two products share the same English Translation.  So you can say, this is green tea powder, grounded green tea, powdered green tea.  However, you must not even hint this is the same green tea powder that can be used for the formal Japanese tea ceremony.  Simply, if you call this \"Maccha\" or \"Matcha,\" you are lying.  And you can be actually sued, and you will lose.  Not only this seller, but I find many sellers are falsely including \"Matccha\" or \"Matcha\" for non-MATCHA GREEN TEA POWDER.  So I believe this is just the innocent mistake.  I encourage the sellers to correct their mistakes, though.\n",

      "To be honest, I have never written a review, not matter how good or bad a product I received was. I never had the time and never bothered. Today, I write my very first review of a product that I have been feeding my precious son since birth. He is now 2 years 4 months. I could never breastfeed him exclusively due to bone density loss and I did massive amounts of research and tried out tons of different brands before deciding on this organic formula from Earth's Best and since then, even though he is now a toddler, I still use the Earth's Best infant formula and supplement with other child vitamins.<br /><br />I was trying to re-order again in bulk from Amazon when I noticed for the first time the controversy over DHA/ARA extraction by the use of toxic hexane of which Hain Celestial which manufactures Earth's Best is guilty of. To understand my utter complete fury, you must know that I live in Singapore and I quite literally pay international shipping for every can of this formula (and wade through customs declarations, tests and tax levies) to bring this milk to my son. In Singapore, this can of milk is also available but in highly limited quantities and even more princely prices (yes, even after the tax, customs and shipping, it still costs less than US$68 which is the going price per can here). Calls to Hain Celestial customer service drove me further up the wall when first, a lady said the hexane was only in trace amounts and less than what the FDA approved. Then, reaching another lady an hour later, the story was different. She said that the hexane solvent method was the only method approved by the FDA to extract the DHA/ARA from non-toxic algae and soil fungus. A third occasion and Hain's customer service informed me that there should be no hexane detected in the product but on further probing admitted that she was not aware if the formula had undergone independent third party tests.<br /><br />To me, this is crazy. The formula was marketed as a pure organic product and we pay premium prices (especially me!) for a premium product. To find that that they have taken such short cuts is completely unacceptable and the worst thing is that, it turns out that most of the other organic formula companies do this exact irresponsible thing and keep quiet about it. The only company that does not is Baby's Only - it uses a water based process to extract their DHA/ARA from eggs(compare this to Hain's claim that the hexane method is the only one approved by FDA and one wonders why Baby's Only hasn't been hauled up by the FDA yet). My son is going on that pronto once I can get a shipment to Singapore. Unfortunately, Baby's Only is not available in Singapore (not even at princely prices) and my son is going to have to continue ingesting his Earth's Best formula in the interim.\n",

      "I approached the Airport Security Gate and fed my bags into the x-ray machine.<br />\"Sir,\" said the TSA agent, \"is this your bag?\"<br />\"You know it is,\" I replied.<br />\"There's no need to get testy sir,\" he said.<br />The agent escorted me over to a side table.<br />\"Do you mind if I search your bag?\"  he asked.<br />\"What will you do if I say no?\" I asked.<br />\"I'll take you in the back room and we'll strip search you,\" he replied.<br />\"Then by all means, go ahead and search,\" I said.<br />The agent opened my bag and peered inside.<br />\"What do you call this sir?\" the agent asked holding up a pair of nail clippers.<br />\"Those are nail clippers,\" I said.<br />\"I'm going to have to confiscate these,\" he said.<br />\"That's alright,\" I replied, \"they sell them for a dollar in the store next to my departure gate.\"<br />The agent looked at me with hate in his eyes.

      "This is an excellent quality Manuka Honey product.  There is a bit of confusion over the UMF, MGO and OMA rating thing.  UMF is the original and trademarked.  MGO is a newer rating system that does not directly correlate to UMF but is accurate nonetheless.  OMA is Wedderspoon's own rating system for determining activity within the raw honey. From my reading it appears to be pretty equitable to UMF.  This honey is also USDA Organic certified (although that doesn't mean as much these days) to ensure that there are no additive ingredients to the product.<br /><br />As for usage, I have two jars of this honey.  I used the first on my wife's wounds following MOHS surgery for removal of skin cancer.  The results were amazing and the surgeon and plastic surgeon both asked what we were using to allow the wounds to heal up so quickly with minimal scarring.  There was also a staph infection as a result of the surgery that the honey took care of as well.  It takes a bit of diligence to ensure daily dressing changes with fresh honey, but the results pay off.  I ended up pre-soaking gauze with the honey and sandwiching between two layers of plastic wrap to create more manageable \"bandages\".  These were used by my wife when she traveled in addition to direct application to the cleaned wound bed.<br />Basic process: Clean wound with Hydrogen Peroxide, follow with colloidal silver in nebulizer, then drizzle honey into wound and cover wound with pre-soaked gauze pad.  The last bit is to cover the pre-soaked pad with a waterproof dressing like a Telfa-style pad to reduce oozing onto clothing/bedding.  Care must be taken in finding adhesives that do not irritate the skin too much with the frequent dressing changes.  There are also larger waterproof wound dressings with silver-impregnated that might be a good combination.  Main idea is to minimize air-space and keep honey in constant contact with wound bed.<br /><br />If this all sounds new, do some research on honey for wound care at the University of Waikato in New Zealand courtesy of Dr. Peter Molan.<br /><br />Note, this honey is not \"sterilized\" via gamma radiation (which is not supposed to reduce activity in the honey like pasteurization) but is still highly effective.  Honey is resistant to most any spoilage due to its activity and the sterilization process is just an extra step some honey manufacturer's take (Comvita or Summerglow) to be able to sell their products as medical devices in the US.  It will allow the honey to be FDA-approved.  Again, as I understand this is not a requirement but is done largely to gain approval for medical usage in hospitals and clinics.  Check out Medihoney dressings. BTW, I have also used this topically on oral canker sores with great effect! Sores dissappeared in days and not weeks! Applied directly 3 x day.<br /><br />Lastly, the other jar I use for tea and even coffee and it is delicious.  It has a strong floral taste and finish (as would be expected) and is alittle more viscous than other Manuka honeys I have tried.<br /><br />I have tried nearly all Manuka honey brands from NZ as I visit often and find this to be a great option for those of us who need a high-quality active raw Manuka honey without paying a load for shipping up the stuff from down under.  Or you can just ask a friend heading that way to bring you back some :P\n",

      "As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the \"My Kcup\" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use.\n",

      "After reading several of Bruce Fife's books (and they were wonderfully easy-to-read for the non-scientific type), I decided to give coconut oil a try to help with losing weight and getting my blood sugar under control. As a non-medication taking, recently diagnosed diabetic, I want to try whatever natural remedies I can find to stay off insulin and other diabetes meds, in addition to meds for cholesterol, etc. I tried taking a teaspoon or two with meals and a teaspoon btw meals and my blood sugar numbers were noticeably lower the same day. (Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet! I will definitely be using this instead of any oils for all my cooking needs (except a little EVOO mixed together with this for salad dressing.) Also, I'm using on my skin and it feels really soft, plus you also get the internal benefits from using it on your skin! GREAT PRODUCT!\n",

      "I love this gadget.  Compact, all-in-one, easy to use, FOOL PROOF, and ... gives me the CONFIDENCE to make my baby's food.<br /><br />I've read tons of web reviews and blogs about this product, and detractors seem to miss/misunderstand my 'category' of mom.  I cook when I can.  I bake when I get the chance but... mostly, I dont have the time or confidence to pull it off anything 'new'... AND clean up multiple utensils!<br /><br />So many blogs out there chastise the Beaba buyers for wasting money--telling us to buy cheap steamer inserts and dust off our blenders, food processors and food mills...  For my first baby, I listened to these moms (and the Beaba wasnt in the USA yet).  I bought the food mill; I pulled out the steamer insert... and.. I froze.  My baby ate NOTHING BUT JARRED (organic) FOOD!  till she could chew the foods in my comfort zone. Baby food, all the prep and the coordination of all these tools was all so daunting. I was terrified I'd get it wrong... or couldnt keep sterile enough... or would get lost in all the piles of things I'd have to clean after each prep!!<br /><br />THEN THE BEABA!  Little to clean, nothing to get wrong, no digging through drawers and juggling appliances in my limited space!  I LOVE IT! Call me a slacker mom!  But dont call me frivolous with money!!  Organic Baby food is $1.10 a jar and my baby would go through 4-6 a day.  I've had my Beaba for 6 weeks, and it's already paid for itself.<br /><br />BTW, you can adjust the consistency to your baby's taste as he grows.  I figure soon I'll just be using it to steam, not blend.  And... I doubt it will be a permanent fixture in my kitchen! But ... its paid for itself!  Carrots smell like carrots!!! and ... its given me a confidence that I hope extends to other culinary projects!  Slacker moms, buy it.<br /><br />PS Careful if you're reading those blogs re: Beaba and BPA.  Read ALL the blogs.  The most uptodate will lead you to the latest info promising this product IS BPA free.  There are blogs that appear current but have not updated this info.\n",

      "I purchased a burrito from a small shop a few blocks from home. I was unimpressed with their habanero \"hot\" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat.<br /><br />I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of \"Insanity++.\" I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong.<br /><br />I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals.\n",
